aboutme:
  # instructor: "I am an environmental economist working primarily on household energy consumption and quantifying the environmental benefits of renewables and increased energy efficiency. I have taught versions of this course at MSU for around five years, and have worked extensively with R for around 15 years. I received my PhD in environmental economics from Duke in 2019, and did my Undergrad at UC Davis."
  instructor: "In brief, I am a behavioral economist whose research examines how cognitive biases and erroneous social beliefs influence decision-making and our interactions with others. In my research, I utilize a mix of theoretical modeling and experimental studies. These approaches guide the work in the Spartan Psychology and Economics Advanced Research (SPEAR) lab, which I formed in 2023. My teaching emphasizes how psychological factors shape economic choices (EC404; EC895) and the importance of rigorous empirical methods (EC242)."
contactpolicy:
  instructor: "For individual questions, email is the best way to get in contact. So that I know the context, please include [EC242] at the start of your message. Questions regarding material, problem sets, or R coding are best directed to a course channel on Slack so that our TA and others may address your question quickly. I will reply to all queries usually within 24 hours."

  homeworkdue: "All assignments are due on D2L by 11:59pm on the due date. Late work is not accepted. You do not need to submit your .rmd file - just the properly-knitted PDF. All assignments must be properly rendered to PDF using Latex. Make sure you start your assignment sufficiently early such that you have time to address rendering issues. Come to office hours or use the course Slack if you have issues. Using an Rstudio instance on posit.cloud is always a feasible alternative."
