  homeworkdue: "All assignments are due on D2L by 11:59pm on the due date. Late work is not accepted. You do not need to submit your .rmd file - just the properly-knitted PDF. All assignments must be properly rendered to PDF using Latex. Make sure you start your assignment sufficiently early such that you have time to address rendering issues. Come to office hours or use the course Slack if you have issues. Using an Rstudio instance on posit.cloud is always a feasible alternative."
