Each turned-in copy should have the entire group's names at the top.\n\nTurn in your copies no later than **Saturday, February 10th at 11:59 PM.** \n\n:::\n\n\n## Part 1: Rats, rats, rats.\n\nNew York City is full of urban wildlife, and rats are one of the city's most infamous animal mascots. Rats in NYC are plentiful, but they also deliver food, so they're useful too.\n\n`{{% youtube \"PeJUqcbool4\" %}}`{=html}\n\nNYC keeps incredibly detailed data regarding animal sightings, including rats, and [it makes this data publicly available](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-rat-sightings/data).\n\nFor this first project, pretend that you are an analyst with the NYC Mayor's office, and you have been tasked with getting a better understanding of the rat problem. Your job is to use **R and ggplot2** to tell an interesting story hidden in the data. You must create a story by looking carefully at the data, finding some insight into where or when rat sightings occur, and describing to the Mayor how this insight may inform a strategy to address the rats. Your assignment will take the form of a professional memo that presents the data and insights along with appropriate visualizations that communicate the story in-line. Your memo should be approximately 2-4 pages (including plots) and, of course, will use Rmarkdown rendered to PDF using LaTeX.\n\n### Instructions\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. **Download** New York City's database of rat sightings since 2010:\n\n    - [<i class=\"fas fa-file-csv\"></i> `Rat_sightings.csv`](/data/Rat_sightings.csv)\n\n2. **Summarize** the data somehow. The raw data has more than 150,000 rows, which means you'll need to aggregate the data (`filter()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()` will be your friends). Consider looking at the number of sightings per borough, per year, per dwelling type, etc., or a combination of these, like the change in the number sightings across the 5 boroughs between 2010 and 2024. (Of course, I just gave you these ideas, so you'll need to be a bit more creative than just doing exactly what I just said.)\n\n3. **Explore** the data further. Once you have summarized the data in one way, use what you find to further explore other patterns you see in the data. When necessary, you may bring in other data (it is not hard to find and add to your data the population of each borough or the average daily temperature by month, etc.). Be creative, but do so to further explore and analyze. Drill down on something you see in the data to *tell a story*. Remember, as analysts, we are looking for \"patterns in the data\" that are not easily written in closed form.\n\n4. **Create** appropriate visualizations based on the data you summarized and explored. Pay attention to every detail - color choice, labels, axis text, etc.\n\n5. **Write** a polished, professional memo presenting your analysis to the Mayor. The memo should tell the story you found in the data. It should not narrarate your discovery process (e.g. it should **not** say \"we tried looking at...and then ran ggplot(...)) but rather should weave your exploration into a narrarative driven by your graphics, with the text filling in the context. We are specifically looking for a discussion of the following:\n\n    - What story are you telling with your graphics?\n    - How have you applied reasonable standards in visual storytelling?\n    - What policy implication is there (if any)?\n    \n  \n6. **Upload** the following outputs to D2L:\n\n    - A PDF file of your memo with your graphics embedded in it.^[You can approach this in a couple different ways—you can write the memo and then include the full figure and code at the end, [similar to this blog post](https://rud.is/b/2017/09/18/mapping-fall-foliage-with-sf/), or you can write the memo in an incremental way, describing the different steps of creating the figure, ultimately arriving at a clean final figure, [like this blog post](https://rudeboybert.github.io/fivethirtyeight/articles/bechdel.html).] This means you'll need to do all your coding in an `R` Markdown file and embed your code in chunks. \n    - Note that Part 2 of this project should be included in this PDF in it's own section (see below).\n    - Nothing else. **No .Rmd, no code**, nothing but your clean, polished memo with Part 1 and Part 2.\n    \nSome important notes on your assignment\n\n- Your assignment should be clean and polished as if you were a city employee and you were turning in a work product. It should should flow nicely and use subsections (using ```###``` at the start of the line) as appropriate.\n- Do **not** \"annotate\" your thought process (e.g. do not write \"we tried X but there were too many NA's, so we did Y instead\"). This should be a polished memo suitable for turning in as a work product.\n- Your code should **not** appear in your output - it should be only your plots and memo writing. \n  - To turn off code echoing, add `echo = FALSE` in each of your code chunk options (e.g. `{r setup, echo = FALSE}`), or set it globally in the first code chunk inside the `knitr::opts_chunk$set` function.\n    \n    \n### Starter code\n\nI've provided some starter code below. A couple comments about it:\n\n- By default, `read_csv()` treats cells that are empty or \"NA\" as missing values. This rat dataset uses \"N/A\" to mark missing values, so we need to add that as a possible marker of missingness (hence `na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"N/A\")`)\n- To make life easier, I've renamed some of the key variables you might work with. You can rename others if you want.\n- I've also created a few date-related variables (`sighting_year`, `sighting_month`, `sighting_day`, and `sighting_weekday`). You don't have to use them, but they're there if you need them. The functions that create these, like `year()` and `wday()` are part of the **lubridate** library.\n- The date/time variables are formatted like `04/03/2017 12:00:00 AM`, which R is not able to automatically parse as a date when reading the CSV file. You can use the `mdy_hms()` function in the **lubridate** library to parse dates that are structured as \"month-day-year-hour-minute\". There are also a bunch of other iterations of this function, like `ymd()`, `dmy()`, etc., for other date formats.\n- There's one row with an unspecified borough, so I filter that out.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nrats_raw <- read_csv(\"data/Rat_Sightings.csv\", na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"N/A\"))\n# If you get an error that says \"All formats failed to parse. No formats\n# found\", it's because the mdy_hms function couldn't parse the date. The date\n# variable *should* be in this format: \"04/03/2017 12:00:00 AM\", but in some\n# rare instances, it might load without the seconds as \"04/03/2017 12:00 AM\".\n# If there are no seconds, use mdy_hm() instead of mdy_hms().\nrats_clean <- rats_raw %>%\n  rename(created_date = `Created Date`,\n         location_type = `Location Type`,\n         borough = Borough) %>%\n  mutate(created_date = mdy_hms(created_date)) %>%\n  mutate(sighting_year = year(created_date),\n         sighting_month = month(created_date),\n         sighting_day = day(created_date),\n         sighting_weekday = wday(created_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) %>%\n  filter(borough != \"Unspecified\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou'll summarize the data with functions from **dplyr**, including stuff like `count()`, `arrange()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `mutate()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Part 2: Data Hunting\n\nFor the second part of the project, your task is simple. Your group must identify three different data sources^[The three different sources need not be different websites or from different organizations. For example, three different tables from the US Census would be sufficient] for potential use in your final project. You are not bound to this decision.\n\nDo **not** use Kaggle data. While Kaggle is useful for learning data science, part of this assignment is learning how to find actual data in the wild. \n\nFor each dataset, you must write a single short paragraph about what about this data interests you. Add this to the memo from Part 1, using `##` to make a new header in Rmarkdown for this section. \n\n\n## Evaluations\n\nI will evaluate these projects (not the TA). I will only give top marks to those groups showing initiative and cleverness. I will use the following weights for final scores:\n\n__Part 1__\n\n1. Technical difficulty: Does the final project show mastery of the skills we've discussed thus far? Did the underlying data analysis use and expand on the tools we learned in class? Are axes and legends appropriately labeled and are colorblind-friendly colors used? (12 points)\n\n2. Appropriateness of visuals: Do the visualizations communicate the analysis? (10 points)\n\n3. Storytelling: Does your memo clearly convey what you're doing and why? (10 points)\n\n__Part 2__\n\nEach piece of data (and description) is worth 6 points. (18 points total)\n\n\n",
