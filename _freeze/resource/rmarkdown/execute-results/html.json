You can do everything you can with [regular Markdown](/reference/markdown/), but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even [interactive dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and [a package named **blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)).\n\nThe [documentation for R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is extremely comprehensive, and their [tutorials](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [cheatsheets](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html) are excellent—rely on those.\n\nI have created a video walkthrough for using R Markdown for another course, but it is useful here. You can [see it here <i class=\"fas fa-film\"></i>](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/R+Part+3/1_yigvqy1i)]\n\nHere are the most important things you'll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\n\n## Key terms\n\n- **Document**: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n\n- **Chunk**: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n\n    ````markdown\n    ```{r}\n    # Code goes here\n    ```\n    ````\n\n    There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n\n- **Knit**: When you \"knit\" a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you've selected). We will always use PDF for this course.\n\n    You can knit by clicking on the \"Knit\" button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing `⌘⇧K` on macOS or `control + shift + K` on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](../../../img/assignments/knit-button.png){width=30%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Add chunks\n\nThere are three ways to insert chunks:\n\n- Press `⌘⌥I` on macOS or `control + alt + I` on Windows\n\n- Click on the \"Insert\" button at the top of the editor window\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](../../../img/reference/insert-chunk.png){width=30%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n- Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don't do this)\n\n\n## Chunk names\n\nYou can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they'll appear in the list. If you don't include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won't know what it does.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../img/reference/chunk-toc.png){width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the `{r` in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. **All chunk names in your document must be unique.**\n\n````markdown\n```{r name-of-this-chunk}\n# Code goes here\n```\n````\n\n\n## Chunk options\n\nThere are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the [RMarkdown Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) or at [**knitr**'s website](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/).\n\nOptions go inside the `{r}` section of the chunk:\n\n````markdown\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n# Code goes here\n```\n````\n\nThe most common chunk options are these:\n\n- `fig.width=5` and `fig.height=3` (*or whatever number you want*): Set the dimensions for figures\n- `echo=FALSE`: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are\n- `message=FALSE`: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted\n- `warning=FALSE`: Any warnings that R generates are omitted\n- `include=FALSE`: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document. Don't use this on your labs as we need to see your work, but do use this for your final project when the output is to be polished and clean.\n\nYou can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../img/reference/chunk-options.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Chunk `fig.width` and `fig.height`\n\nWhen a code chunk includes a plot (like from `ggplot`), the \"canvas\" size used can affect the output. You may have noticed if you plot directly in Rstudio, the plot resizes when you change the pane size. Each chunk has its own canvas size, and you can change that. So, if you have a chunk with a large plot, you can change the `fig.width=7.5` in the chunk options. Note that units default to inches, so no more than 7.5 will fit on a regular-sized sheet of paper (or appropriately sized PDF).\n\n## Inline chunks\n\nYou can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `` `r r_code_here` ``.\n\nIt's generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n\n````markdown\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE}\navg_mpg <- mean(mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\nThe average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon.\n````\n\n… would knit into this:\n\n> The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n\n## Output formats\n\nYou can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the [YAML front matter](/reference/markdown/#front-matter). \n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"My document\"\noutput:\n  html_document: default\n  pdf_document: default\n  word_document: default\n```\n\nYou can also click on the down arrow on the \"Knit\" button to choose the output *and* generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the \"Knit\" button and choose \"Output options\", you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../img/reference/output-options.png){width=35%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe first output type listed under `output:` will be what is generated when you click on the \"Knit\" button or press the keyboard shortcut (`⌘⇧K` on macOS; `control + shift + K` on Windows). If you choose a different output with the \"Knit\" button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the `output` section.\n\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here's what a typical `output` section might look like:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My document\"\nauthor: \"My name\"\ndate: \"January 13, 2020\"\noutput: \n  html_document: \n    toc: yes\n    fig_caption: yes\n    fig_height: 8\n    fig_width: 10\n  pdf_document: \n    latex_engine: xelatex  # More modern PDF typesetting engine\n    toc: yes\n  word_document: \n    toc: yes\n    fig_caption: yes\n    fig_height: 4\n    fig_width: 5\n---\n```\n\n\n\n# Adding graphics to an Rmarkdown file\n\n### From the web\nIf you are incorporating an image (.png or .jpg) from another site on the web, you can refer to the image directly *provided the web address ends in `.png` or `.jpg` or `.gif`. Google image search makes it a little hard to get directly to the image source, so click through a search until you get to the original image. Once you're there, right-click on the image and select \"Copy Image Address\" (may vary by system). If you can paste the URL into a new window and get the image itself, you're good to go with the instructions here. Some sites and formats do not host the images as a separate file -- they may be generated by an app. For instance, if we go to [https://msu.edu/students](https://msu.edu/students), the background image address is not available by right-clicking. But scrolling down, the image for the Student Information System is [https://student.msu.edu/](https://student.msu.edu/). In cases where the image address is not readily available, you'll have to take a screenshot and use the instructions in the next section (or dig into the site code if you know how to do that sort of thing). Let's work on getting this image into our output: [https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg).\n\nNote that using a web address for an image means if the image owner changes the address or removes the image, you won't be able to re-knit your document. See the next section for downloading the image and inserting into your document.\n\nThere are two ways of inserting an image: in markdown text, or in a code chunk. Both work. I prefer using the code chunk method, which uses `knitr::include_graphics`. This is an R function, so you use it inside a code chunk. When you are including an image inside a code chunk, the code chunk options can be used to control the `fig.width` or `fig.height`, and `fig.align`. For instance, `fig.width = '75%'` will use 75% of the available page width, whatever it may be. The down side is that you have to pull a copy of the image from the web and save it locally (earlier versions of Rmarkdown would do this for you automatically, but this feature was removed in rmarkdown v1.6 for security reasons). Here's the code to do so:\n\n### Images inserted in code chunks\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.markdown .cell-code}\n```{r, fig.width = '75%', fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}\ndownload.file(\"https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg\", destfile = 'temporary.jpg')\nknitr::include_graphics(path = 'temporary.jpg')\n```\n````\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe file you specify with `destfile` doesn't matter - R will create that file, but you do need to use the corresponding suffix (don't use `temporary.jpg` if you're downloading a `.png`). By default, the file will be saved in the same folder as your .rmd file. When `include_graphics` goes to read the file, it will start looking relative to the folder that contains your .rmd file. That is, `download.file` will copy the image to the same place that `include_graphics` looks for it. See below for more on relative filepaths. \n\nNote the code chunk option set above as well - `fig.width='75%'`, which is stated in the curly-brackets that head the chunk. This is where Knitr finds details about how you want to handle the output. Before, we saw that `echo=T` would add a copy of the code itself to the output (vs. `echo=F` which output only the result). Similarly, `fig.width='75%'` should size the output to take up about 75\\% of the text width. You can also use `fig.width=8` to set the output to 8 inches wide (closet to the width of a sheet of paper), which will maximize the space used for your plot. You may need this if/when you start plotting larger things. Hint. \n\n### Images inserted via Markdown\nThe markdown language is what controls the text outside of the R code chunks. It has its own way of inserting images. Here the image is inserted in the text, **not** in a code chunk.\n\n```\n![](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg\")\n```\n\n![](https://msu.edu/-/media/assets/msu/images/audience-student/students-sis-home.jpg\")\n\n\n### Images from a local file\nWhether you have the file on your hard drive already, right-click and download from the web to keep a copy for posterity, or save the image from a screenshot, you will often need to insert an image from a local file. In Rmarkdown, the path will always be *relative to the folder containing your .Rmd file*. So if you keep your .Rmd in `/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3` and you have a folder `/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images` that contains a file `picture.png`, then you would tell Rmarkdown to find the file at `./images/picture.png` (which implies its filepath is `/Users/jkirk/SSC442/Example3/images/picture.png`). The `./` tells R to start looking in the local directory holding the .Rmd file you're working on.\n\nOnce you know your local relative path, you can use either of the above methods `knitr::include_graphics('./images/picture.png')` or `![](./images/picture.png)`.\n\nIt is possible for R to find your image with an incorrect filepath when you click the \"run chunk\" button, but then not be able to find it when you knit. This can be very frustrating. It is almost always because you do not have the right *relative* filepath.\n\n\n",
