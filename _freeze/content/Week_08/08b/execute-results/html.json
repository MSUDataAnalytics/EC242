Now, we will ignore much of what we have learned and instead simply use regression as a tool to **predict**. Instead of a model which explains relationships, we seek a model which minimizes errors.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../images/regression.png){width=458}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, note that a linear model is one of many methods used in regression.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo discuss linear models in the context of prediction, we introduce the (very boring) `Advertising` data that is discussed in the ISL text (see supplemental readings). It can be found at [https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv](https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAdvertising <- read_csv('https://www.statlearning.com/s/Advertising.csv')\nAdvertising = Advertising %>% \n  dplyr::select(TV, radio, newspaper, sales)\nAdvertising\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 200 × 4\n      TV radio newspaper sales\n   <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 230.   37.8      69.2  22.1\n 2  44.5  39.3      45.1  10.4\n 3  17.2  45.9      69.3   9.3\n 4 152.   41.3      58.5  18.5\n 5 181.   10.8      58.4  12.9\n 6   8.7  48.9      75     7.2\n 7  57.5  32.8      23.5  11.8\n 8 120.   19.6      11.6  13.2\n 9   8.6   2.1       1     4.8\n10 200.    2.6      21.2  10.6\n# ℹ 190 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can take a look at the relationship between `sales` and the three modes of advertising using the `patchwork` package (or any number of other ways)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)\ntv = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = TV, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\nrad = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = radio, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\nnews = ggplot(Advertising, aes(x = newspaper, y = sales)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()\ntv + rad + news\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere we see a relationship between each of the advertising modes and sales, but we might want to know more. Specifically, we probably want to know something about the sales-maximizing combination of the three modes. For that, we'd need a good model of sales. But what does \"good\" mean?\n\n\n## Assesing Model Accuracy\n\nThere are many metrics to assess the accuracy of a regression model. Most of these measure in some way the average error that the model makes. The metric that we will be most interested in is the root-mean-square error.\n\n$$\n\\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nWhile for the sake of comparing models, the choice between RMSE and MSE is arbitrary, we have a preference for RMSE, as it has the same units as the response variable. Also, notice that in the prediction context MSE refers to an average, whereas in an ANOVA (`summary(lm(...))`) context, the denominator for MSE may not be $n$.\n\nFor a linear model , the estimate of $f$, $\\hat{f}$, is given by the fitted regression line.\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}({\\bf{x}_i}) = \\hat{f}({\\bf{x}_i})\n$$\n\nWe can write an `R` function that will be useful for performing this calculation.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrmse = function(actual, predicted) {\n  sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Model Complexity\n\nAside from how well a model predicts, we will also be very interested in the complexity (flexibility) of a model. For now, we will only consider nested linear models for simplicity. What is a \"nested model\"? When you have \"nested models\", then one model contains all of the *same* terms that the other model has. If we have `TV`, `Radio`, `Newspaper`, then we would have a \"nested model\" in this case:\n\n```\nmodel1 = lm(sales ~ TV + radio, data = Advertising)\nmodel2 = lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, data = Advertising)\n```\n\nHere, `model1` is nested in `model2`. Here are **non-nested models**:\n\n```\nmodel1 = lm(sales ~ TV + radio, data = Advertising)\nmodel2 = lm(sales ~ TV + newspaper, data = Advertising)\n```\n\nWhen we add polynomial terms, we always add the lower-order terms as well. This will always make a nested model:\n\n```\nmodel1 = lm(sales ~ TV + radio, data = Advertising)\nmodel2 = lm(sales ~ TV + TV^2 + radio + radio^2, data = Advertising)\nmodel3 = lm(sales ~ TV + TV^2 + radio + radio^2 + TV:radio, data = Advertising)\n```\n\nThose are nested models -- 1 and 2 use a subset of terms from 3, and 1 uses a subset of 2.\n\nWhen models are nested, then the more predictors that a model has, the more complex the model. For the sake of assigning a numerical value to the complexity of a linear model, we will use the number of predictors, $p$.\n\nWe write a simple `R` function to extract this information from a model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_complexity = function(model) {\n  length(coef(model)) - 1\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Test-Train Split\n\nThere is an issue with fitting a model to all available data then using RMSE to determine how well the model predicts. It is essentially cheating! As a linear model becomes more complex, the RSS, thus RMSE, can never go up. It will only go down, or in very specific cases, stay the same.\n\nThis would suggest that to predict well, we should use the largest possible model! However, in reality we have hard fit to a specific dataset, but as soon as we see new data, a large model may in fact predict poorly. This is called **overfitting**.\n\n### Overfitting in action\nLet's take a quick look at why overfitting may harm us, despite the notion that we want to minimize RMSE. I'm going to take a 20-row subset of `Advertising` and fit a 16th-degree polynomial. If you remember your mathematics training, an Nth degree polynomial has N-1 \"inflection points\", which translates to fitting a curve with 15 inflections. That's pretty flexible! R is smart and won't let us fit a 20-degree polynomial, though. Here's as close as we can get:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmallset = Advertising %>% slice(1:20)\nflexible.lm = lm(sales ~ poly(TV, 16), smallset)\nsummary(flexible.lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ poly(TV, 16), data = smallset)\n\nResiduals:\n         1          2          3          4          5          6          7 \n 6.804e-03 -1.362e-01 -8.586e-02  1.154e+00 -7.661e-01  9.626e-01  5.371e-01 \n         8          9         10         11         12         13         14 \n 1.509e-01 -9.328e-01 -7.052e+00 -1.591e+00 -2.264e-01  8.249e-02 -1.121e-01 \n        15         16         17         18         19         20 \n 3.317e+00  4.554e+00  7.361e-02 -1.741e-06  1.143e+00 -1.078e+00 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

We certainly don't trust that huge spike at 250, either! But how do we stop ourselves from overfitting?\n\n::: {.calllout-note}\n## TRY IT\n\nWhen I was a teenager and had to drive in the snow for the first time, my mom took me out to an empty, frozen roller rink parking lot. She had me drive fast, then slam on the brakes so that we slid on the ice. The point was, you can be told what it's like to skid, but until you do it, it's abstract. \n\nLet's make overfitting concrete.\n\nRun the following code to download and subset some data. The code does a couple other things. Can you tell what?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(242)\n\nRECS = read.csv('https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/csv/recs2009_public.csv', stringsAsFactors = F) %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%  \n  slice(sample(1:n()), 30) %>%\n  dplyr::select(EnergyUsed = TOTALBTU, \n                REGIONC, DIVISION, Climate_Region_Pub, METROMICRO, Urban=UR, OWNRENT = KOWNRENT,YEARMADERANGE, \n                Occupants = OCCUPYYRANGE,ColdDays = HDD65, HotDayss = CDD65, SquareFeet = TOTHSQFT, CarsGarage = SIZEOFGARAGE, \n                AgeOfHome = YEARMADERANGE, TreeShade = TREESHAD, TVSize = TVSIZE1, HeaterAge = EQUIPAGE, HasAC = AIRCOND,\n                TempHome = TEMPHOME) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(HeaterAge != -2 & TempHome !=-2)  %>% # get rid of some NA's\n  dplyr::mutate(var1 = rnorm(n(), mean=0, sd = 1),\n                var2 = rnorm(n(), mean=10, sd = .5),\n                var3 = rpois(n(), 5),\n                var4 = runif(n(), -10, 0))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of potential X-values here, so we don't just make a scatterplot (what would we put on the X axis?). But we can plot a histogram of this just to see what we're up against:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(RECS) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = EnergyUsed))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, my challenge to you is to estimate a linear-in-parameters model that minimizes RMSE (using your RMSE function) for a prediction of `EnergyUsed`. Use as many variables as you want. Don't use the `poly` function like we did before, since that's too easy. Who can get the lowest RMSE? \n\n:::\n\n### Avoiding overfitting\n\nFrequently we will take a dataset of interest and split it in two. One part of the datasets will be used to fit (train) a model, which we will call the **training** data. The remainder of the original data will be used to assess how well the model is predicting, which we will call the **test** data. Test data should *never* be used to train a model.\n\nNote that sometimes the terms *evaluation set* and *test set* are used interchangeably. We will give somewhat specific definitions to these later. For now we will simply use a single test set for a training set.\n\nHere we use the `sample()` function to obtain a random sample of the rows of the original data. We then use those row numbers (and remaining row numbers) to split the data accordingly. Notice we used the `set.seed()` function to allow use to reproduce the same random split each time we perform this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(90)\nnum_obs = nrow(Advertising)\n\ntrain_index = sample(num_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * num_obs))\ntrain_data = Advertising[train_index, ]\ntest_data = Advertising[-train_index, ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will look at two measures that assess how well a model is predicting, the **train RMSE** and the **test RMSE**.\n\n$$\n\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Train}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Train Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Tr}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Train}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nHere $n_{Tr}$ is the number of observations in the train set. Train RMSE will still always go down (or stay the same) as the complexity of a linear model increases. That means train RMSE will not be useful for comparing models, but checking that it decreases is a useful sanity check.\n\n$$\n\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Test}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Test Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Te}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Test}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nHere $n_{Te}$ is the number of observations in the test set. Test RMSE uses the model fit to the training data, but evaluated on the unused test data. This is a measure of how well the fitted model will predict **in general**, not simply how well it fits data used to train the model, as is the case with train RMSE. What happens to test RMSE as the size of the model increases? That is what we will investigate.\n\nWe will start with the simplest possible linear model, that is, a model with no predictors.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit_0 = lm(sales ~ 1, data = train_data)\nget_complexity(fit_0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# train RMSE\nsqrt(mean((train_data$sales - predict(fit_0, train_data)) ^ 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5.224106\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# test RMSE\nsqrt(mean((test_data$sales - predict(fit_0, test_data)) ^ 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5.211881\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe previous two operations obtain the train and test RMSE.

The train RMSE can be seen in blue, while the test RMSE is given in orange.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(model_complexity, train_rmse, type = \"b\",\n     ylim = c(min(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) - 0.02,\n              max(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) + 0.02),\n     col = \"dodgerblue\",\n     xlab = \"Model Size\",\n     ylab = \"RMSE\")\nlines(model_complexity, test_rmse, type = \"b\", col = \"darkorange\")\nlegend('topright', legend = c('train','test'), col = c('dodgerblue','darkorange'), lty=1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](08b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe also summarize the results as a table. `fit_1` is the least flexible, and `fit_5` is the most flexible. We see the Train RMSE decrease as flexibility increases. We see that the Test RMSE is smallest for `fit_3`, thus is the model we believe will perform the best on future data not used to train the model. Note this may not be the best model, but it is the best model of the models we have seen in this example.\n\n| Model   | Train RMSE        | Test RMSE        | Predictors              |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| `fit_1` | 1.6493463 | 1.7416416 | 3 |\n| `fit_2` | 0.9875248 | 0.9014459 | 7 |\n| `fit_3` | 0.6685005 | 0.6242491 | 8 |\n| `fit_4` | 0.6676294 | 0.6232819 | 10 |\n| `fit_5` | 0.6359041 | 0.7809674 | 14 |\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Underfitting models:** In general *High* Train RMSE, *High* Test RMSE. Seen in `fit_1` and `fit_2`.\n- **Overfitting models:** In general *Low* Train RMSE, *High* Test RMSE. Seen in `fit_4` and `fit_5`.\n\nSpecifically, we say that a model is overfitting if there exists a less complex model with lower Test RMSE. Then a model is underfitting if there exists a more complex model with lower Test RMSE.\n\nA number of notes on these results:\n\n- The labels of under and overfitting are *relative* to the best model we see, `fit_3`. Any model more complex with higher Test RMSE is overfitting. Any model less complex with higher Test RMSE is underfitting.\n- The train RMSE is guaranteed to follow this non-increasing pattern. The same is not true of test RMSE. Here we see a nice U-shaped curve. There are theoretical reasons why we should expect this, but that is on average. Because of the randomness of one test-train split, we may not always see this result. Re-perform this analysis with a different seed value and the pattern may not hold. We will discuss why we expect this next chapter. We will discuss how we can help create this U-shape much later.\n- Often we expect train RMSE to be lower than test RMSE. Again, due to the randomness of the split, you may get lucky and this will not be true.\n\nA final note on the analysis performed here; we paid no attention whatsoever to the \"assumptions\" of a linear model. We only sought a model that **predicted** well, and paid no attention to a model for **explaination**. Hypothesis testing did not play a role in deciding the model, only prediction accuracy. Collinearity? We don't care. Assumptions? Still don't care. Diagnostics? Never heard of them. (These statements are a little over the top, and not completely true, but just to drive home the point that we only care about prediction. Often we latch onto methods that we have seen before, even when they are not needed.)\n",
