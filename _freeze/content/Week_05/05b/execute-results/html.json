I have moved the Random Variables section from Tuesday to the top here on Thursday as well. If you read through today's material already, you'll see that it starts with \"Part II\" below, and the in-class exercise has been removed.\n\n\n# Part I: Random variables\n\nIn data science, we often deal with data that is affected by chance in some way: the data comes from a random sample, the data is affected by measurement error, or the data measures some outcome that is random in nature. Being able to quantify the uncertainty introduced by randomness is one of the most important jobs of a data analyst. Statistical inference offers a framework, as well as several practical tools, for doing this. The first step is to learn how to mathematically describe random variables.\n\nIn this section, we introduce random variables and their properties starting with their application to games of chance. We then describe some of the events surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008^[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008] using probability theory. This financial crisis was in part caused by underestimating the risk of certain securities^[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Security_(finance)] sold by financial institutions. Specifically, the risks of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) were grossly underestimated. These assets were sold at prices that assumed most homeowners would make their monthly payments, and the probability of this not occurring was calculated as being low. A combination of factors resulted in many more defaults than were expected, which led to a price crash of these securities. As a consequence, banks lost so much money that they needed government bailouts to avoid closing down completely.\n\n## Definition of Random variables\n\nRandom variables are numeric outcomes resulting from random processes. We can easily generate random variables using some of the simple examples we have shown. For example, define `X` to be 1 if a bead is blue and red otherwise:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeads <- rep( c(\"red\", \"blue\"), times = c(2,3))\nX <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == \"blue\", 1, 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere `X` is a random variable: every time we select a new bead the outcome changes randomly.  See below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nifelse(sample(beads, 1) == \"blue\", 1, 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nifelse(sample(beads, 1) == \"blue\", 1, 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nifelse(sample(beads, 1) == \"blue\", 1, 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it's 1 and sometimes it's 0.\n\n\n## Sampling models\n\nMany data generation procedures, those that produce the data we study, can be modeled quite well as draws from an urn. For instance, we can model the process of polling likely voters as drawing 0s (Republicans) and 1s (Democrats) from an urn containing the 0 and 1 code for all likely voters. In epidemiological studies, we often assume that the subjects in our study are a random sample from the population of interest. The data related to a specific outcome can be modeled as a random sample from an urn containing the outcome for the entire population of interest. Similarly, in experimental research, we often assume that the individual organisms we are studying, for example worms, flies, or mice, are a random sample from a larger population. Randomized experiments can also be modeled by draws from an urn given the way individuals are assigned into groups: when getting assigned, you draw your group at random. Sampling models are therefore ubiquitous in data science. Casino games offer a plethora of examples of real-world situations in which sampling models are used to answer specific questions. We will therefore start with such examples.\n\nSuppose a very small casino hires you to consult on whether they should set up roulette wheels. To keep the example simple, we will assume that 1,000 people will play and that the only game you can play on the roulette wheel is to bet on red or black. The casino wants you to predict how much money they will make or lose. They want a range of values and, in particular, they want to know what's the chance of losing money. If this probability is too high, they will pass on installing roulette wheels.\n\nWe are going to define a random variable $S$ that will represent the casino's total winnings. Let's start by constructing the urn. A roulette wheel has 18 red pockets, 18 black pockets and 2 green ones. So playing a color in one game of roulette is equivalent to drawing from this urn:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolor <- rep(c(\"Black\", \"Red\", \"Green\"), c(18, 18, 2))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe 1,000 outcomes from 1,000 people playing are independent draws from this urn. If red comes up, the gambler wins and the casino loses a dollar, so we draw a -1. Otherwise, the casino wins a dollar and we draw a 1. To construct our random variable $S$, we can use this code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1000\nX <- sample(ifelse(color == \"Red\", -1, 1),  n, replace = TRUE)\nX[1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] -1  1  1 -1 -1 -1  1  1  1  1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBecause we know the proportions of 1s and -1s, we can generate the draws with one line of code, without defining `color`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe call this a **sampling model** since we are modeling the random behavior of roulette with the sampling of draws from an urn. The total winnings $S$ is simply the sum of these 1,000 independent draws:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(100)\nX <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))\nS <- sum(X)\nS\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## The probability distribution of a random variable\n\nIf you run the code above, you see that $S$ changes every time. This is, of course, because $S$ is a **random variable**. The probability distribution of a random variable tells us the probability of the observed value falling at any given interval. So, for example, if we want to know the probability that we lose money, we are asking the probability that $S$ is in the interval $S<0$.\n\nNote that if we can define a cumulative distribution function $F(a) = \\mbox{Pr}(S\\leq a)$, then we will be able to answer any question related to the probability of events defined by our random variable $S$, including the event $S<0$. We call this $F$ the random variable's _distribution function_.\n\nWe can estimate the distribution function for the random variable $S$ by using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate many realizations of the random variable. With this code, we run the experiment of having 1,000 people play roulette, over and over, specifically $B = 10,000$ times:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(200)\nn <- 1000\nB <- 10000\nroulette_winnings <- function(n){\n  X <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))\n  sum(X)\n}\nS <- replicate(B, roulette_winnings(n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow we can ask the following: in our simulations, how often did we get sums less than or equal to `a`?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(S <= a)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a very good approximation of $F(a)$ and we can easily answer the casino's question: how likely is it that we will lose money? We can see it is quite low:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(S<0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.0474\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can visualize the distribution of $S$ by creating a histogram showing the probability $F(b)-F(a)$ for several intervals $(a,b]$:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/normal-approximates-distribution-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the distribution appears to be approximately normal. A qq-plot will confirm that the normal approximation is close to a perfect approximation for this distribution. If, in fact, the distribution is normal, then all we need to define the distribution is the average and the standard deviation. Because we have the original values from which the distribution is created, we can easily compute these with `mean(S)` and `sd(S)`. The blue curve you see added to the histogram above is a normal density with this average and standard deviation.\n\nThis average and this standard deviation have special names. They are referred to as the _expected value_ and _standard error_ of the random variable $S$. We will say more about these in the next section where we will discuss an incredibly useful approximation provided by mathematical theory that applies generally to sums and averages of draws from any urn: the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\n\n## Distributions versus probability distributions\n\nBefore we continue, let's make an important distinction and connection between the distribution of a list of numbers and a probability distribution. In the visualization lectures, we described how any list of numbers $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ has a distribution. The definition is quite straightforward. We define $F(a)$ as the function that tells us what proportion of the **list** is less than or equal to $a$. Because they are useful summaries when the distribution is approximately normal, we define the average and standard deviation. These are defined with a straightforward operation of the vector containing the list of numbers `x`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm <- sum(x)/length(x)\ns <- sqrt(sum((x - m)^2) / length(x))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA random variable $X$ has a distribution **function**. To define this, we do not need a list of numbers. It is a theoretical concept. In this case, we define the distribution as the $F(a)$ that answers the question: what is the probability that $X$ is less than or equal to $a$? There is no list of numbers.\n\nHowever, if $X$ is defined by drawing from an urn with numbers in it, then there is a list: the list of numbers inside the urn. In this case, the distribution of that list is the probability distribution of $X$ and the average and standard deviation of that list are the expected value and standard error of the random variable.\n\nAnother way to think about it that does not involve an urn is to run a Monte Carlo simulation and generate a very large list of outcomes of $X$. These outcomes are a list of numbers. The distribution of this list will be a very good approximation of the probability distribution of $X$. The longer the list, the better the approximation. The average and standard deviation of this list will approximate the expected value and standard error of the random variable.\n\n## Notation for random variables\n\nIn statistical textbooks, upper case letters are used to denote random variables and we follow this convention here. Lower case letters are used for observed values. You will see some notation that includes both. For example, you will see events defined as $X \\leq x$. Here $X$ is a random variable, making it a random event, and $x$ is an arbitrary value and not random. So, for example, $X$ might represent the number on a die roll and $x$ will represent an actual value we see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So in this case, the probability of $X=x$ is 1/6 regardless of the observed value $x$. This notation is a bit strange because, when we ask questions about probability, $X$ is not an observed quantity. Instead, it's a random quantity that we will see in the future. We can talk about what we expect it to be, what values are probable, but not what it is. But once we have data, we do see a realization of $X$. So data scientists talk of what could have been after we see what actually happened.\n\n\n## The expected value and standard error\n\nWe have described sampling models for draws. We will now go over the mathematical theory that lets us approximate the probability distributions for the sum of draws. Once we do this, we will be able to help the casino predict how much money they will make. The same approach we use for the sum of draws will be useful for describing the distribution of averages and proportion which we will need to understand how polls work.\n\nThe first important concept to learn is the _expected value_.\nIn statistics books, it is common to use letter $\\mbox{E}$ like this:\n\n$$\\mbox{E}[X]$$\n\nto denote the expected value of the random variable $X$.\n\nA random variable will vary around its expected value in a way that if you take the average of many, many draws, the average of the draws will approximate the expected value, getting closer and closer the more draws you take.\n\nTheoretical statistics provides techniques that facilitate the calculation of expected values in different circumstances. For example, a useful formula tells us that the *expected value of a random variable defined by one draw is the average of the numbers in the urn*. In the urn used to model betting on red in roulette, we have 20 one dollars and 18 negative one dollars. The expected value is thus:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}[X] = (20 + -18)/38\n$$\n\nwhich is about 5 cents. It is a bit counterintuitive to say that $X$ varies around 0.05, when the only values it takes is 1 and -1. One way to make sense of the expected value in this context is by realizing that if we play the game over and over, the casino wins, on average, 5 cents per game. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nB <- 10^6\nx <- sample(c(-1,1), B, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.053422\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn general, if the urn has two possible outcomes, say $a$ and $b$, with proportions $p$ and $1-p$ respectively, the average is:\n\n$$\\mbox{E}[X] = ap + b(1-p)$$\n\nTo see this, notice that if there are $n$ beads in the urn, then we have $np$ $a$s and $n(1-p)$ $b$s and because the average is the sum, $n\\times a \\times p + n\\times b \\times (1-p)$, divided by the total $n$, we get that the average is $ap + b(1-p)$.\n\nNow the reason we define the expected value is because this mathematical definition turns out to be useful for approximating the probability distributions of sum, which then is useful for describing the distribution of averages and proportions. The first useful fact is that the *expected value of the sum of the draws* is:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{}\\mbox{number of draws } \\times \\mbox{ average of the numbers in the urn}\n$$\n\nSo if 1,000 people play roulette, the casino expects to win, on average, about 1,000 $\\times$ \\$0.05  = \\$50.  But this is an expected value. How different can one observation be from the expected value? The casino really needs to know this. What is the range of possibilities? If negative numbers are too likely, they will not install roulette wheels. Statistical theory once again answers this question. The _standard error_  (SE) gives us an idea of the size of the variation around the expected value. In statistics books, it's common to use:\n\n$$\\mbox{SE}[X]$$\n\nto denote the standard error of a random variable.\n\n**If our draws are independent**, then the *standard error of the sum* is given by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\mbox{number of draws }} \\times \\mbox{ standard deviation of the numbers in the urn}\n$$\n\nUsing the definition of standard deviation, we can derive, with a bit of math, that if an urn contains two values $a$ and $b$ with proportions $p$ and $(1-p)$, respectively, the standard deviation is:\n\n$$\\mid b - a \\mid \\sqrt{p(1-p)}.$$\n\nSo in our roulette example, the standard deviation of the values inside the urn is: $\\mid 1 - (-1) \\mid \\sqrt{10/19 \\times 9/19}$ or:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 * sqrt(90)/19\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.998614\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe standard error tells us the typical difference between a random variable and its expectation. Since one draw is obviously the sum of just one draw, we can use the formula above to calculate that the random variable defined by one draw has an expected value of 0.05 and a standard error of about 1. This makes sense since we either get 1 or -1, with 1 slightly favored over -1.\n\nUsing the formula above, the sum of 1,000 people playing has standard error of about \\$32:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1000\nsqrt(n) * 2 * sqrt(90)/19\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 31.57895\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, when 1,000 people bet on red, the casino is expected to win \\$50 with a standard error of \\$32. It therefore seems like a safe bet. But we still haven't answered the question: how likely is it to lose money? Here the CLT will help.\n\n**Advanced note**: Before continuing we should point out that exact probability calculations for the casino winnings can be performed with the binomial distribution. However, here we focus on the CLT, which can be generally applied to sums of random variables in a way that the binomial distribution can't.\n\n### Population SD versus the sample SD\n\nThe standard deviation of a list `x` (below we use heights as an example) is defined as the square root of the average of the squared differences:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dslabs)\nx <- heights$height\nm <- mean(x)\ns <- sqrt(mean((x-m)^2))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe SD is the the square root of the sample variance, and the sample variance is the square of the sample SD. Using mathematical notation we write:\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\sigma =  \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2}\n$$\n\nHowever, be aware that the `sd` function returns a slightly different result:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nidentical(s, sd(x))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns-sd(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -0.001942661\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is because the `sd` function R does not return the `sd` of the list, but rather uses a formula that estimates standard deviations of a population from a random sample $X_1, \\dots, X_N$ which, for reasons not discussed here, divide the sum of squares by the $N-1$.\n\n\n$$\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i, \\,\\,\\,\\,\ns =  \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}\n$$\n\nYou can see that this is the case by typing:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- length(x)\ns-sd(x)*sqrt((n-1) / n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFor all the theory discussed here, you need to compute the actual standard deviation as defined:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(mean((x-m)^2))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo be careful when using the `sd` function in R. However, keep in mind that throughout the book we sometimes use the `sd` function when we really want the actual SD. This is because when the list size is big, these two are practically equivalent since $\\sqrt{(N-1)/N} \\approx 1$.\n\n## Central Limit Theorem\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that when the number of draws, also called the _sample size_, is large, the probability distribution of the **sum** of the independent draws is approximately normal. Because sampling models are used for so many data generation processes, the CLT is considered one of the most important mathematical insights in history.\n\nPreviously, we discussed that if we know that the distribution of a list of numbers is approximated by the normal distribution, all we need to describe the list are the average and standard deviation. We also know that the same applies to probability distributions. If a random variable has a probability distribution that is approximated with the normal distribution, then all we need to describe the probability distribution are the average and standard deviation, referred to as the expected value and standard error.\n\nWe previously ran this Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1000\nB <- 10000\nroulette_winnings <- function(n){\n  X <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))\n  sum(X)\n}\nS <- replicate(B, roulette_winnings(n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the sum $S$ is approximated by a normal distribution.\nUsing the formulas above, we know that the expected value and standard error are:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn * (20-18)/38\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 52.63158\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(n) * 2 * sqrt(90)/19\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 31.57895\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe theoretical values above match those obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(S)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 52.3038\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(S)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 31.20746\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CLT, we can skip the Monte Carlo simulation and instead compute the probability of the casino losing money using this approximation:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmu <- n * (20-18)/38\nse <-  sqrt(n) * 2 * sqrt(90)/19\npnorm(0, mu, se)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.04779035\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nwhich is also in very good agreement with our Monte Carlo result:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(S < 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.0446\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIt's pretty powerful to have a function representing the outcome's distribution, instead of having a (possibly huge) list of sampled outcomes.\n\n### How large is large in the Central Limit Theorem?\n\nThe CLT works when the number of draws is large. But large is a relative term. In many circumstances as few as 30 draws is enough to make the CLT useful. In some specific instances, as few as 10 is enough. However, these should not be considered general rules. Note, for example, that when the probability of success is very small, we need much larger sample sizes.\n\nBy way of illustration, let's consider the lottery. In the lottery, the chances of winning are less than 1 in a million. Thousands of people play so the number of draws is very large. Yet the number of winners, the sum of the draws, range between 0 and 4. This sum is certainly not well approximated by a normal distribution, so the CLT does not apply, even with the very large sample size. This is generally true when the probability of a success is very low. In these cases, the Poisson distribution is more appropriate.\n\nYou can examine the properties of the Poisson distribution using `dpois` and `ppois`. You can generate random variables following this distribution with `rpois`. However, we do not cover the theory here. You can learn about the Poisson distribution in any probability textbook and even Wikipedia^[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Poisson_distribution]\n\n\n## Statistical properties of averages\n\nThere are several useful mathematical results that we used above and often employ when working with data. We list them below.\n\n1\\. The expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of each random variable's expected value. We can write it like this:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}[X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n] =  \\mbox{E}[X_1] + \\mbox{E}[X_2]+\\dots+\\mbox{E}[X_n]\n$$\n\nIf the $X$ are independent draws from the urn, then they all have the same expected value. Let's call it $\\mu$ and thus:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}[X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n]=  n\\mu\n$$\n\nwhich is another way of writing the result we show above for the sum of draws.\n\n2\\. The expected value of a non-random constant times a random variable is the non-random constant times the expected value of a random variable. This is easier to explain with symbols:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}[aX] =  a\\times\\mbox{E}[X]\n$$\n\nTo see why this is intuitive, consider change of units. If we change the units of a random variable, say from dollars to cents, the expectation should change in the same way. A consequence of the above two facts is that the expected value of the average of independent draws from the same urn is the expected value of the urn, call it $\\mu$ again:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}[(X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n) / n]=   \\mbox{E}[X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n] / n = n\\mu/n = \\mu\n$$\n\n\n3\\. The square of the standard error of the sum of **independent** random variables is the sum of the square of the standard error of each random variable. This one is easier to understand in math form:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{SE}[X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n] = \\sqrt{\\mbox{SE}[X_1]^2 + \\mbox{SE}[X_2]^2+\\dots+\\mbox{SE}[X_n]^2  }\n$$\n\nThe square of the standard error is referred to as the _variance_ in statistical textbooks. Note that this particular property is not as intuitive as the previous three and more in depth explanations can be found in statistics textbooks.\n\n4\\. The standard error of a non-random constant times a random variable is the non-random constant times the random variable's standard error. As with the expectation:\n$$\n\\mbox{SE}[aX] =  a \\times \\mbox{SE}[X]\n$$\n\nTo see why this is intuitive, again think of units.\n\nA consequence of 3 and 4 is that the standard error of the average of independent draws from the same urn is the standard deviation of the urn divided by the square root of $n$ (the number of draws), call it $\\sigma$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{SE}[(X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n) / n] &=   \\mbox{SE}[X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_n]/n \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\mbox{SE}[X_1]^2+\\mbox{SE}[X_2]^2+\\dots+\\mbox{SE}[X_n]^2}/n \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\sigma^2+\\sigma^2+\\dots+\\sigma^2}/n\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{n\\sigma^2}/n\\\\\n&= \\sigma / \\sqrt{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n5\\. If $X$ is a normally distributed random variable, then if $a$ and $b$ are non-random constants, $aX + b$ is also a normally distributed random variable. All we are doing is changing the units of the random variable by multiplying by $a$, then shifting the center by $b$.\n\n\nNote that statistical textbooks use the Greek letters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ to denote the expected value and standard error, respectively. This is because $\\mu$ is the Greek letter for $m$, the first letter of _mean_, which is another term used for expected value. Similarly, $\\sigma$ is the Greek letter for $s$, the first letter of standard error.\n\n## Law of large numbers\n\nAn important implication of the final result is that the standard error of the average becomes smaller and smaller as $n$ grows larger. When $n$ is very large, then the standard error is practically 0 and the average of the draws converges to the average of the urn. This is known in statistical textbooks as the law of large numbers or the law of averages.\n\n\n### Misinterpreting law of averages\n\nThe law of averages is sometimes misinterpreted. For example, if you toss a coin 5 times and see a head each time, you might hear someone argue that the next toss is probably a tail because of the law of averages: on average we should see 50\\% heads and 50\\% tails. A similar argument would be to say that red \"is due\" on the roulette wheel after seeing black come up five times in a row. These events are independent so the chance of a coin landing heads is 50\\% regardless of the previous 5. This is also the case for the roulette outcome. The law of averages applies only when the number of draws is very large and not in small samples. After a million tosses, you will definitely see about 50\\% heads regardless of the outcome of the first five tosses.\n\nAnother funny misuse of the law of averages is in sports when TV sportscasters predict a player is about to succeed because they have failed a few times in a row.\n\n\nProbabilistic thinking is central in the human experience. How we describe that thinking is mixed, but most of the time we use (rather imprecise) language. With only a few moments of searching, one can find thousands of articles that use probabilistic words to describe events. Here are some examples:\n\n> \"'Highly unlikely' State of the Union will happen amid shutdown\" – The Hill\n\n> \"Tiger Woods makes Masters 15th and most improbable major\" – Fox\n\n> \"Trump predicts 'very good chance' of China trade deal\" – CNN\n\nYet people don't have a good sense of what these things mean. Uncertainty is key to data analytics: if we were certain of things, A study in the 1960s explored the perception of probabilistic words like these among NATO officers. A more modern replication of this found the following basic pattern: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../images/words.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA deep, basic fact about humans is that we struggle to understand probabilities. But visualizing things can help. The graphic above shows the uncertainty about uncertainty (very meta). We can convey all manner of uncertainty with clever graphics. Today's practical example works through some of the myriad of ways to visualize variable data. We'll cover some territory that we've already hit, in hopes of locking in some key concepts.\n\n# Part 2: Statistical Inference and Polls\n\nIn this Example we will describe, in some detail, how poll aggregators such as FiveThirtyEight use data to predict election outcomes. To understand how they do this, we first need to learn the basics of _Statistical Inference_, the part of statistics that helps distinguish patterns arising from signal from those arising from chance. Statistical inference is a broad topic and here we go over the very basics using polls as a motivating example. To describe the concepts, we complement the mathematical formulas with Monte Carlo simulations and `R` code.\n\n\n## Polls\n\nOpinion polling has been conducted since the 19th century. The general goal is to describe the opinions held by a specific population on a given set of topics. In recent times, these polls have been pervasive during presidential elections. Polls are useful when interviewing every member of a particular population is logistically impossible. The general strategy is to interview a smaller group, chosen at random, and then infer the opinions of the entire population from the opinions of the smaller group. Statistical theory is used to justify the process. This theory is referred to as  _inference_ and it is the main topic of this chapter.\n\nPerhaps the best known opinion polls are those conducted to determine which candidate is preferred by voters in a given election. Political strategists make extensive use of polls to decide, among other things, how to invest resources. For example, they may want to know in which geographical locations to focus their \"get out the vote\" efforts.\n\nElections are a particularly interesting case of opinion polls because the actual opinion of the entire population is revealed on election day. Of course, it costs millions of dollars to run an actual election which makes polling a cost effective strategy for those that want to forecast the results.\n\nAlthough typically the results of these polls are kept private, similar polls are conducted by news organizations because results tend to be of interest to the general public and made public. We will eventually be looking at such data.\n\nReal Clear Politics^[http://www.realclearpolitics.com] is an example of a news aggregator that organizes and publishes poll results. For example, they present the following poll results reporting estimates of the popular vote for the 2016 presidential election^[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html]:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!-- (Source: [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)) -->\n\nAlthough in the United States the popular vote does not determine the result of the presidential election, we will use it as an illustrative and simple example of how well polls work. Forecasting the election is a more complex process since it involves combining results from 50 states and DC and we will go into some detail on this later.\n\nLet's make some observations about the table above. First, note that different polls, all taken days before the election, report a different _spread_:  the estimated difference between support for the two candidates. Notice also that the reported spreads hover around what ended up being the actual result: Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%. We also see a column titled **MoE** which stands for _margin of error_.\n\nIn this example, we will show how the probability concepts we learned in the previous content can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool. We will learn the statistical concepts necessary to define _estimates_ and _margins of errors_, and show how we can use these to forecast final results relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of our forecast. Once we learn this, we will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: _confidence intervals_ and _p-values_. Finally, to understand probabilistic statements about the probability of a candidate winning, we will have to learn about Bayesian modeling. In the final sections, we put it all together to recreate the simplified version of the FiveThirtyEight model and apply it to the 2016 election.\n\nWe start by connecting probability theory to the task of using polls to learn about a population.\n\n\n### The sampling model for polls\n\nTo help us understand the connection between polls and what we have learned, let's construct a similar situation to the one pollsters face. To mimic the challenge real pollsters face in terms of competing with other pollsters for media attention, we will use an urn full of beads to represent  voters and pretend we are competing for a \\$25 dollar prize. The challenge is to guess the spread between the proportion of blue and red beads in this hypothetical urn.\n \nBefore making a prediction, you can take a sample (with replacement) from the urn. To mimic the fact that running polls is expensive, it costs you 10 cents per each bead you sample. Therefore, if your sample size is 250, and you win, you will break even since you will pay \\\\$25 to collect your \\\\$25 prize. Your entry into the competition can be an interval. If the interval you submit contains the true proportion, you get half what you paid and pass to the second phase of the competition. In the second phase, the entry with the smallest interval is selected as the winner.\n\nThe __dslabs__ package includes a function that shows a random draw from this urn:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dslabs)\ntake_poll(25)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/first-simulated-poll-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThink about how you would construct your interval based on the data shown above.\n\nWe have just described a simple sampling model for opinion polls. The beads inside the urn represent the individuals that will vote on election day. Those that will vote for the Republican candidate are represented with red beads and the Democrats with the blue beads. For simplicity, assume there are no other colors. That is, that there are just two parties: Republican and Democratic.\n\n## Populations, samples, parameters, and estimates\n\nWe want to predict the proportion of blue beads in the urn. Let's call this quantity $p$, which then tells us the proportion of red beads $1-p$, and the spread $p - (1-p)$, which simplifies to $2p - 1$.\n\nIn statistical textbooks, the beads in the urn are called the _population_. The proportion of blue beads in the population $p$  is called a _parameter_. The 25 beads we see in the previous plot are called a _sample_. The task of statistical inference is to predict the parameter $p$ using the observed data in the sample.\n\nCan we do this with the 25 observations above? It is certainly informative. For example, given that we see 13 red and 12 blue beads, it is unlikely that $p$ > .9 or $p$ < .1. But are we ready to predict with certainty that there are more red beads than blue in the jar?\n\nWe want to construct an estimate of $p$ using only the information we observe. An estimate should be thought of as a summary of the observed data that we think is informative about the parameter of interest. It seems intuitive to think that the proportion of blue beads in the sample $0.48$ must be at least related to the actual proportion $p$. But do we simply predict $p$ to be 0.48? First, remember that the sample proportion is a random variable. If we run the command `take_poll(25)` four times, we get a different answer each time, since the sample proportion is a random variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/four-simulated-polls-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the four random samples shown above, the sample proportions range from 0.44 to 0.60. By describing the distribution of this random variable, we will be able to gain insights into how good this estimate is and how we can make it better.\n\n### The sample average\n\nConducting an opinion poll is being modeled as taking a random sample from an urn. We are proposing the use of the proportion of blue beads in our sample as an _estimate_ of the parameter $p$. Once we have this estimate, we can easily report an estimate for the spread $2p-1$, but for simplicity we will illustrate the concepts for estimating $p$. We will use our knowledge of probability to defend our use of the sample proportion and quantify how close we think it is from the population proportion $p$.\n\nWe start by defining the random variable $X$ as: $X=1$ if we pick a blue bead at random and $X=0$ if it is red. This implies that the population is a list of 0s and 1s. If we sample $N$ beads, then the average of the draws $X_1, \\dots, X_N$ is equivalent to the proportion of blue beads in our sample. This is because adding the $X$s is equivalent to counting the blue beads and dividing this count by the total $N$ is equivalent to computing a proportion. We use the symbol $\\bar{X}$ to represent this average. In general, in statistics textbooks a bar on top of a symbol means the average. The theory we just learned about the sum of draws becomes useful because the average is a sum of draws multiplied by the constant $1/N$:\n\n$$\\bar{X} = 1/N \\times \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$$\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the draws are independent: after we see each sampled bead, we return it to the urn. In this case, what do we know about the distribution of the sum of draws? First, we know that the expected value of the sum of draws is $N$ times the average of the values in the urn. We know that the average of the 0s and 1s in the urn must be $p$, the proportion of blue beads.\n\nHere we encounter an important difference with what we did in the Probability chapter: we don't know what is in the urn. We know there are blue and red beads, but we don't know how many of each. This is what we want to find out: we are trying to **estimate** $p$.\n\n### Parameters\n\nJust like we use variables to define unknowns in systems of equations, in statistical inference we define _parameters_ to define unknown parts of our models. In the urn model which we are using to mimic an opinion poll, **we do not know the proportion of blue beads in the urn**. We define the parameters $p$ to represent this quantity. $p$ is the average of the urn because if we take the average of the 1s (blue) and 0s (red), we get the proportion of blue beads. Since our main goal is figuring out what is $p$, we are going to _estimate this parameter_.\n\nThe ideas presented here on how we estimate parameters, and provide insights into how good these estimates are, extrapolate to many data science tasks. For example, we may want to determine the difference in health improvement between patients receiving treatment and a control group. We may ask, what are the health effects of smoking on a population? What are the differences in racial groups of fatal shootings by police? What is the rate of change in life expectancy in the US during the last 10 years? All these questions can be framed as a task of estimating a parameter from a sample.\n\n### Polling versus forecasting\n\nBefore we continue, let's make an important clarification related to the practical problem of forecasting the election. If a poll is conducted four months before the election, it is estimating the $p$ for that moment and not for election day. The $p$ for election night might be different since people's opinions fluctuate through time. The polls provided the night before the election tend to be the most accurate since opinions don't change that much in a day. However, forecasters try to build tools that model how opinions vary across time and try to predict the election night results taking into consideration the fact that opinions fluctuate. We will describe some approaches for doing this in a later section.\n\n### Properties of our estimate: expected value and standard error\n\nTo understand how good our estimate is, we will describe the statistical properties of the random variable defined above: the sample proportion $\\bar{X}$. Remember that $\\bar{X}$ is the sum of independent draws so the rules we covered in the probability chapter apply.\n\nUsing what we have learned, the expected value of the sum $N\\bar{X}$ is $N \\times$ the average of the urn, $p$. So dividing by the non-random constant $N$ gives us that the expected value of the average $\\bar{X}$ is $p$. We can write it using our mathematical notation:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = p\n$$\n\nWe can also use what we learned to figure out the standard error: the standard error of the sum is $\\sqrt{N} \\times$ the standard deviation of the urn. Can we compute the standard error of the urn? We learned a formula that tells us that it is $(1-0) \\sqrt{p (1-p)}$ = $\\sqrt{p (1-p)}$. Because we are dividing the sum by $N$, we arrive at the following formula for the standard error of the average:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}\n$$\n\nThis result reveals the power of polls. The expected value of the sample proportion $\\bar{X}$ is the parameter of interest $p$ and we can make the standard error as small as we want by increasing $N$. The law of large numbers tells us that with a large enough poll, our estimate converges to $p$.\n\nIf we take a large enough poll to make our standard error about 1%, we will be quite certain about who will win. But how large does the poll have to be for the standard error to be this small?\n\nOne problem is that we do not know $p$, so we can't compute the standard error. However, for illustrative purposes, let's assume that $p=0.51$ and make a plot of the standard error versus the sample size $N$:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/standard-error-versus-sample-size-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot we see that we would need a poll of over 10,000 people to get the standard error that low. We rarely see polls of this size due in part to costs. From the Real Clear Politics table, we learn that the sample sizes in opinion polls range from 500-3,500 people. For a sample size of 1,000 and $p=0.51$, the standard error is:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(p*(1-p))/sqrt(1000)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.01580823\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nor 1.5 percentage points. So even with large polls, for close elections, $\\bar{X}$ can lead us astray if we don't realize it is a random variable. Nonetheless, we can actually say more about how close we get the $p$.\n\n:::{.callout-info}\n## Central Limit Theorem {#clt}\n\nIf we didn't cover this earlier this week, let's talk about it here:\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the distribution function for a sum of draws is approximately normal. You also may recall that dividing a normally distributed random variable by a constant is also a normally distributed variable. This implies that the distribution of $\\bar{X}$ is approximately normal.\n\nIn summary, we have that $\\bar{X}$ has an approximately normal distribution with expected value $p$ and standard error $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$.\n\nNow how does this help us? Suppose we want to know what is the probability that we are within 1% from $p$. We are basically asking what is\n\n$$\n\\mbox{Pr}(| \\bar{X} - p| \\leq .01)\n$$\nwhich is the same as:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{Pr}(\\bar{X}\\leq p + .01) - \\mbox{Pr}(\\bar{X} \\leq p - .01)\n$$\n\nCan we answer this question?  We can use the mathematical trick we learned in the previous lecture. Subtract the expected value and divide by the standard error to get a standard normal random variable, call it $Z$, on the left. Since $p$ is the expected value and $\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$ is the standard error we get:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{ \\,.01} {\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X})} \\right) -\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq - \\frac{ \\,.01} {\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X})} \\right)\n$$\n\nOne problem we have is that since we don't know $p$, we don't know $\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X})$. But it turns out that the CLT still works if we estimate the standard error by using $\\bar{X}$ in place of $p$. We say that we _plug-in_ the estimate. Our estimate of the standard error is therefore:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})=\\sqrt{\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})/N}\n$$\nIn statistics textbooks, we use a little hat to denote estimates. The estimate can be constructed using the observed data and $N$.\n\nNow we continue with our calculation, but dividing by $\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})=\\sqrt{\\bar{X}(1-\\bar{X})/N})$ instead. In our first sample we had 12 blue and 13 red so $\\bar{X} = 0.48$ and our estimate of standard error is:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_hat <- 0.48\nse <- sqrt(x_hat*(1-x_hat)/25)\nse\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.09991997\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can answer the question of the probability of being close to $p$. The answer is:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npnorm(0.01/se) - pnorm(-0.01/se)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.07971926\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, there is a small chance that we will be close. A poll of only $N=25$ people is not really very useful, at least not for a close election.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Margin of Error\n\nEarlier we mentioned the _margin of error_. Now we can define it because it is simply 1.96 times the standard error, which we can now estimate. In our case it is:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.96*se\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1958431\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we multiply by 1.96? Because if you ask what is the probability that we are within 1.96 standard errors from $p$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq \\, 1.96\\,\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X})  / \\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) \\right) -\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq - 1.96\\, \\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) / \\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) \\right)\n$$\nwhich is:\n\n$$\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq 1.96 \\right) -\n\\mbox{Pr}\\left(Z \\leq - 1.96\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich we know is about 95\\%:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npnorm(1.96)-pnorm(-1.96)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.9500042\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHence, there is a 95% probability that $\\bar{X}$ will be within $1.96\\times \\hat{SE}(\\bar{X})$, in our case within about 0.2, of $p$. Note that 95% is somewhat of an arbitrary choice and sometimes other percentages are used, but it is the most commonly used value to define margin of error. We often round 1.96 up to 2 for simplicity of presentation.\n\nIn summary, the CLT tells us that our poll based on a sample size of $25$ is not very useful. We don't really learn much when the margin of error is this large. All we can really say is that the popular vote will not be won by a large margin. This is why pollsters tend to use larger sample sizes.\n\nFrom the table above, we see that typical sample sizes range from 700 to 3500. To see how this gives us a much more practical result, notice that if we had obtained a $\\bar{X}$=0.48 with a sample size of 2,000, our standard error $\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})$ would have been 0.0111714. So our result is an estimate of `48`% with a margin of error of 2%. In this case, the result is much more informative and would make us think that there are more red balls than blue. Keep in mind, however, that this is hypothetical. We did not take a poll of 2,000 since we don't want to ruin the competition.\n\n\n::: {.callout-info}\n## A Monte Carlo simulation\n(Optional) Suppose we want to use a Monte Carlo simulation to corroborate the tools we have built using probability theory. To create the simulation, we would write code like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nB <- 10000\nN <- 1000\nx_hat <- replicate(B, {\n  x <- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))\n  mean(x)\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, of course, we don't know `p`. We could construct an urn like the one pictured above and run an analog (without a computer) simulation. It would take a long time, but you could take 10,000 samples, count the beads and keep track of the proportions of blue. We can use the function `take_poll(n=1000)` instead of drawing from an actual urn, but it would still take time to count the beads and enter the results.\n\nOne thing we therefore do to corroborate theoretical results is to pick one or several values of `p` and run the simulations.  Let's set `p=0.45`.  We can then simulate a poll:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- 0.45\nN <- 1000\n\nx <- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))\nx_hat <- mean(x)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn this particular sample, our estimate is `x_hat`. We can use that code to do a Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nB <- 10000\nx_hat <- replicate(B, {\n  x <- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))\n  mean(x)\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo review, the theory tells us that $\\bar{X}$ is approximately normally distributed, has expected value $p=$ 0.45 and standard error $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$ = 0.0157321. The simulation confirms this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x_hat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.4500761\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(x_hat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.01579523\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA histogram and qq-plot confirm that the normal approximation is accurate as well:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/normal-approximation-for-polls-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOf course, in real life we would never be able to run such an experiment because we don't know $p$. But we could run it for various values of $p$ and $N$ and see that the theory does indeed work well for most values. You can easily do this by re-running the code above after changing `p` and `N`.\n\n:::\n\n### The spread\n\nThe competition is to predict the spread, not the proportion $p$. However, because we are assuming there are only two parties, we know that the spread is $p - (1-p) = 2p - 1$.  As a result, everything we have done can easily be adapted to an estimate of $2p - 1$. Once we have our estimate $\\bar{X}$ and $\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})$, we estimate the spread with $2\\bar{X} - 1$ and, since we are multiplying by 2, the standard error is $2\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})$. Note that subtracting 1 does not add any variability so it does not affect the standard error.\n\nFor our 25 item sample above, our estimate $p$ is `.48` with margin of error `.20` and our estimate of the spread is `0.04` with margin of error `.40`. Again, not a very useful sample size. However, the point is that once we have an estimate and standard error for $p$, we have it for the spread $2p-1$.\n\n\n### Bias: why not run a very large poll?\n\nFor realistic values of $p$, say from 0.35 to 0.65, if we run a very large poll with 100,000 people, theory tells us that we would predict the election perfectly since the largest possible margin of error is around 0.3\\%:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/standard-error-versus-p-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOne reason is that running such a poll is very expensive. Another possibly more important reason is that theory has its limitations. Polling is much more complicated than picking beads from an urn. Some people might lie to pollsters and others might not have phones. But perhaps the most important way an actual poll differs from an urn model is that we actually don't know for sure who is in our population and who is not. How do we know who is going to vote? Are we reaching all possible voters? Hence, even if our margin of error is very small, it might not be exactly right that our expected value is $p$. We call this bias. Historically, we observe that polls are indeed biased, although not by that much. The typical bias appears to be about 1-2%. This makes election forecasting a bit more interesting and we will talk about how to model this in our Assignment for this week.\n\n\n\n\n# Part 3: (Supplemental) Additional Visualization Techniques that We Won't Have Time For In Class\n\nFor this second part of the example, we're going to use historical weather data from [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/forecast/33.7546,-84.39/us12/en) about wind speed and temperature trends for downtown Atlanta ([specifically `33.754557, -84.390009`](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33°45'16.4\"N+84°23'24.0\"W/@33.754557,-84.3921977,17z/)) in 2019. We downloaded this data using Dark Sky's (about-to-be-retired-because-they-were-bought-by-Apple) API using the [ **darksky** package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/darksky).\n\nIf you want to follow along with this example, you can download the data below (you'll likely need to right click and choose \"Save Link As…\"):\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-csv\"></i> `atl-weather-2019.csv`](/data/atl-weather-2019.csv)\n\n\n## Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Load and clean data\n\nFirst, we load the libraries we'll be using:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(gghalves)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThen we load the data with `read_csv()`. Here we assume that the CSV file lives in a subfolder in my project named `data`. Naturally, you'll need to point this to wherever you stashed the data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweather_atl_raw <- read_csv(\"data/atl-weather-2019.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll add a couple columns that we can use for faceting and filling using the `month()` and `wday()` functions from **lubridate** for extracting parts of the date:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweather_atl <- weather_atl_raw %>%\n  mutate(Month = month(time, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),\n         Day = wday(time, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow we're ready to go!\n\n### Histograms\n\nWe can first make a histogram of wind speed. We'll use a bin width of 1 and color the edges of the bars white:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/basic-histogram-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is fine enough, but we can improve it by forcing the buckets/bins to start at whole numbers instead of containing ranges like 2.5–3.5. We'll use the `boundary` argument for that. We also add `scale_x_continuous()` to add our own x-axis breaks instead of having things like 2.5, 5, and 7.5:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\", boundary = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/basic-histogram-better-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can show the distribution of wind speed by month if we map the `Month` column we made onto the fill aesthetic:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\", boundary = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/histogram-by-month-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is colorful, but it's impossible to actually interpret. Instead of only filling, we'll also facet by month to see separate graphs for each month. We can turn off the fill legend because it's now redundant.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, fill = Month)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\", boundary = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 1)) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Month))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/histogram-by-month-facet-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNeat! January, March, and April appear to have the most variation in windy days, with a few wind-less days and a few very-windy days, while August was very wind-less.\n\n### Density plots beyond `geom_density`\n\nOr we can stack the density plots behind each other with [**ggridges**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html). For that to work, we also need to map `Month` to the y-axis. We can reverse the y-axis so that January is at the top if we use the `fct_rev()` function:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/ggridges-basic-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can add some extra information to `geom_density_ridges()` with some other arguments like `quantile_lines`. We can use the `quantiles` argument to tell the plow how many parts to be cut into. Since we just want to show the median, we'll set that to 2 so each density plot is divided in half:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = windSpeed, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/ggridges-quantile-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have good working code, we can easily substitute in other variables by changing the x mapping:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = temperatureHigh, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = Month)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/ggridges-quantile-temp-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can get extra fancy if we fill by temperature instead of filling by month. To get this to work, we need to use `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`, and we need to change the `fill` mapping to the strange looking `..x..`, which is a weird ggplot trick that tells it to use the variable we mapped to the x-axis. For whatever reason, `fill = temperatureHigh` doesn't work:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl, aes(x = temperatureHigh, y = fct_rev(Month), fill = ..x..)) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(x = \"High temperature\", y = NULL, color = \"Temp\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/ggridges-gradient-temp-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we can get *extra* fancy and show the distributions for both the high and low temperatures each month. To make this work, we need to manipulate the data a little. Right now there are two columns for high and low temperature: `temperatureLow` and `temperatureHigh`. To be able to map temperature to the x-axis and high vs. low to another aesthetic (like `linetype`), we need a column with the temperature and a column with an indicator variable for whether it is high or low. This data needs to be tidied (since right now we have a variable (high/low) encoded in the column name). We can tidy this data using `pivot_longer()` from **tidyr**, which was already loaded with `library(tidyverse)`. In the RStudio primers, you did this same thing with `gather()`—`pivot_longer()` is the newer version of `gather()`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweather_atl_long <- weather_atl %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(temperatureLow, temperatureHigh),\n               names_to = \"temp_type\",\n               values_to = \"temp\") %>%\n  # Clean up the new temp_type column so that \"temperatureHigh\" becomes \"High\", etc.\n  mutate(temp_type = recode(temp_type,\n                            temperatureHigh = \"High\",\n                            temperatureLow = \"Low\")) %>%\n  # This is optional—just select a handful of columns\n  select(time, temp_type, temp, Month)\n\n# Show the first few rows\nhead(weather_atl_long)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  time                temp_type  temp Month  \n  <dttm>              <chr>     <dbl> <ord>  \n1 2019-01-01 05:00:00 Low        50.6 January\n2 2019-01-01 05:00:00 High       63.9 January\n3 2019-01-02 05:00:00 Low        49.0 January\n4 2019-01-02 05:00:00 High       57.4 January\n5 2019-01-03 05:00:00 Low        53.1 January\n6 2019-01-03 05:00:00 High       55.3 January\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a column for the temperature (`temp`) and a column indicating if it is high or low (`temp_type`). The dataset is also twice as long (730 rows) because each day has two rows (high and low). Let's plot it and map high/low to the `linetype` aesthetic to show high/low in the border of the plots:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl_long, aes(x = temp, y = fct_rev(Month),\n                             fill = ..x.., linetype = temp_type)) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(x = \"High temperature\", y = NULL, color = \"Temp\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/ggridges-gradient-temp-high-low-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can see much wider temperature disparities during the summer, with large gaps between high and low, and relatively equal high/low temperatures during the winter.\n\n\n### Box, violin, and rain cloud plots\n\nFinally, we can look at the distribution of variables with box plots, violin plots, and other similar graphs. First, we'll make a box plot of windspeed, filled by the `Day` variable we made indicating weekday:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(y = windSpeed, fill = Day)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/basic-boxplot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can switch this to a violin plot by just changing the `geom` layer and mapping `Day` to the x-axis:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +\n  geom_violin()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/basic-violin-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith violin plots it's typically good to overlay other geoms. We can add some jittered points for a strip plot:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/violin-strip-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add larger points for the daily averages. We'll use a special layer for this: `stat_summary()`. It has a slightly different syntax, since we're not actually mapping a column from the dataset. Instead, we're feeding a column from a dataset into a function (here `\"mean\"`) and then plotting that result:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\", fun = \"mean\", size = 5, color = \"white\") +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/violin-strip-mean-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can also show the mean and confidence interval at the same time by changing the summary function:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(y = windSpeed, x = Day, fill = Day)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"pointrange\", fun.data = \"mean_se\", size = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/violin-strip-mean-ci-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOverlaying the points directly on top of the violins shows extra information, but it's also really crowded and hard to read. If we use [the **gghalves** package](https://github.com/erocoar/gghalves), we can use special halved versions of some of these geoms like so:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +\n  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(aes(fill = Day), side = \"r\") +\n  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/gghalves-point-boxplot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote the `side` argument for specifying which half of the column the geom goes. We can also use `geom_half_violin()`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +\n  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_violin(aes(fill = Day), side = \"r\") +\n  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/gghalves-point-violon-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf we flip the plot, we can make a [rain cloud plot](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(weather_atl,\n       aes(x = fct_rev(Day), y = temperatureHigh)) +\n  geom_half_boxplot(aes(fill = Day), side = \"l\", width = 0.5, nudge = 0.1) +\n  geom_half_point(aes(color = Day), side = \"l\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_half_violin(aes(fill = Day), side = \"r\") +\n  guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05b_files/figure-html/gghalves-rain-cloud-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n",
