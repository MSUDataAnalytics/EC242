## Building the website

Heiss site + associated github:
https://evalsp24.classes.andrewheiss.com
https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalsp24.classes.andrewheiss.com/blob/main/_quarto.yml

Our site:
https://main--earnest-crostata-11dc6a.netlify.app



## Build
Builds to _docs
Have not yet set it to search files. Will need to scan content/Week* folders.

## Images inserted
Right now, using here() to top of directory, then pointing to here('/images/...') or data for images. Copying to website seems to work fine.






## Themes
The default was yeti. I wanted to change $primary defined in yeti (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes/yeti.scss) to MSU green #18453b, so I added a yetiADD.scss file and updated the $primary and defined $MSUgreen
