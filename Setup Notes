## Build
Builds to _docs
Have not yet set it to search files. Will need to scan content/Week* folders.



## Sidebar
the `content` folder will automatically add files (incl. in subdirectories) to the "contents" sidebar defined in _quarto.yml. It'll follow folders and will name based on folder name (e.g. Week 00 from Week_00). Title on the sidebar comes from title on the .qmd files. For the "content" folder, a index.qmd file there sets the title (and provides main content page content)

Show a sidebar (of specific id) on a page by adding `sidebar` in the yml header. It appears just doing this on the index.qmd for that folder cascades down to each of the pages? Lab Assignments has the right one, even though only the assignments/index.qmd has the sidebar in the yml header.


## Shortcodes
  favicons shortcodes are enabled (added as extention in terminal) {{< >}}
    -->   {{< fa file-arrow-down title=Alt description">}}
    
  Quarto has built-in _variables.yml shortcode (and meta(data), but that only refers to things recognized in yml header). Set variables in _variables.yml, then refer to them by {{< var variablename.subvariable >}} and they'll render.
  
  FOR OUR USES, I'll make a _variablesJustin and a _variablesBen, and we can switch off over-writing _variables.yml with our respective files (Quarto is hardcoded to use _variables.yml and doesn't yet have functionality to add/merge/switch).
  
  I am using _variables.yml to set the due dates for labs. Enter them under duedates.lab1, etc., and each file will refer to that for the header YML value of "duedate", which is then shortcode referred to in the body using {{< meta duedate >}} (which refers to the document's header metadata value of duedate).
  
  I **highly** recommend having _variables.yml open while updating the site, just to get th e {{< var xxxx >}} vars correct.
  
  




## Callouts and CSS/SCSS
An example can be found on the quarto website under "callouts" - to use one of the built-in ones, use 
    
    ::: {.callout-tips/warning/...}
    # The header title in the callout box taken fromt he first header in the code block
    The text in the box
    :::





## Images inserted
Right now, using here() to top of directory, then pointing to here('/images/...') or data for images. Copying to website seems to work fine.


## Data and Static Files
Following images, using here('data/...') and copying all the old static/data contents over. Should have one source for all site data with static address for linking for assignments.




## Themes
The default was yeti. I wanted to change $primary defined in yeti (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes/yeti.scss) to MSU green #18453b, so I added a `yetiADD.scss` file and updated the $primary and defined $MSUgreen
