## Building the website

Heiss site + associated github:

## Build
Builds to _docs




## Sidebar
the `content` folder will automatically add files (incl. in subdirectories) to the "contents" sidebar defined in _quarto.yml. It'll follow folders and will name based on folder name (e.g. Week 00 from Week_00). Title on the sidebar comes from title on the .qmd files. For the "content" folder, a index.qmd file there sets the title (and provides main content page content)

I do the same with the 'assignment' folder so it builds a sidebar for lab assignments. Need to add a sidebar for projects there as well still. Will have to do that manually

Show a sidebar (of specific id) on a page by adding `sidebar` in the yml header. It appears just doing this on the index.qmd for that folder cascades down to each of the pages? Lab Assignments has the right one, even though only the assignments/index.qmd has the sidebar in the yml header.

Folders are named without plural s' so that sidebar title can be diff from folder
I think "projects" or "project" is protected as I get an error when I try to use "project" in contents (to sweep the project folder for sidebar contents)
Right now, Assignments page has both lab and projects in sidebar (built in _quarto.yml). Lab Assignments are built by scanning/assignment, but Group Projects are entered manually. In the sidebar, Lab Assignments inserts a second-level "assignments" title (based on a capitalized version of the folder name). I can't get ridof it,but theremight be some settings that will. Not worried about it rightnow.




## Shortcodes
  favicons shortcodes are enabled (added as extention in terminal) {{< >}}, as are bootstrap: https://icons.getbootstrap.com
    -->   {{< fa file-arrow-down title=Alt description">}}
    -->   {{< bi suitcase >}}    
    
  Quarto has built-in _variables.yml shortcode (and meta(data), but that only refers to things recognized in yml header). Set variables in _variables.yml, then refer to them by {{< var variablename.subvariable >}} and they'll render.
  
  FOR OUR USES, I'll make a _variablesJustin and a _variablesBen, and we can switch off over-writing _variables.yml with our respective files (Quarto is hardcoded to use _variables.yml and doesn't yet have functionality to add/merge/switch).
  
  I am using _variables.yml to set the due dates for labs. Enter them under duedates.lab1, etc., and each file will refer to that for the header YML value of "duedate", which is then shortcode referred to in the body using {{< meta duedate >}} (which refers to the document's header metadata value of duedate).
  
  I **highly** recommend having _variables.yml open while updating the site, just to get th e {{< var xxxx >}} vars correct.
  
  




## Callouts and CSS/SCSS
An example can be found on the quarto website under "callouts" - to use one of the built-in ones, use 
    
    ::: {.callout-tips/warning/... title="Can put it here but use double-quotes only"}
    # Or here - The header title in the callout box taken fromt he first header in the code block
    The text in the box
    :::

You can change some things on the callouts: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/language/_language.yml, but I haven't yet figured out how to make a new one (I'd like a "try it!" callout format). But maybe just change callout-tip? or callout-note?

Keep callout-warning and callout-important and callout-tip, but change callout-note to "try-it" and callout-caution to "do-it".




## Images inserted
Right now, using here() to top of directory, then pointing to here('/images/...') or data for images. INternal copying to website folder seems to work fine, alleviating the biggest problem with the old site.

I think to copy images to the site, the _quarto.yml doc has to allow rendering the material (e.g. comment out the !Week_13/13a.qmd)


## Data and Static Files
Following images, using here('data/...') and copying all the old static/data contents over. Should have one source for all site data with static address for linking for assignments.




## Themes
The default was yeti. I wanted to change $primary defined in yeti (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes/yeti.scss) to MSU green #18453b, so I added a `yetiADD.scss` file and updated the $primary and defined $MSUgreen

Yeti theme samplesheet: https://bootswatch.com/yeti/
Yeti (bootstrap) css: https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/blob/v5/dist/yeti/bootstrap.css

[Inline css]{.text-emphasis} or choose from https://bootswatch.com/yeti/
::: {.text-emphasis}

Andrew Heiss has a lot of custom scss in his site: https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalsp24.classes.andrewheiss.com/blob/main/html/custom.scss



## Links
To refer to a page that is an index for a folder like content or assignment, use (/assignment/). For schedule or syllabus (or a weekly content) use (/syllabus.html) or (/content/Week_01/01a.html). A section can be added (/content/Week_01/01b.html#factors)


## Screenshots-to-page
https://github.com/Toniiiio/imageclipr
I use this (an "add in" to Rstudio) that copies the clipboard (screenshot) to a new file in the current location, then inserts a reference to it. It would be nice if it went to the Image folder and refered to it there, but this makes it feasible to incorporate screenshots quickly.


## Rendering during semester
Use the _quarto render section to set what to render (and what not to render). Use this to update as things are ready.






#### STILL TO DO
Just use callout-note. No alterations.
