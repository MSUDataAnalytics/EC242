Others can learn from your issues.\n    - We have a channel just for labs and R. Please use that one.\n    \n\n### Group project\nIf you read ahead, you'd have seen a bit about our group project. I'd like to wait until after the add/drop deadline to do this as people come and go, ruining my group assignments. Know that we will have groups of 3, and you will be given the opportunity to form your own groups with default groups for those who do not form one. All groups must be exactly 3 people.\n\n\n### Share your screen\nWe will often do some shared coding results -- you'll be asked to execute some code, and we'll use Zoom to share screen so the class can see volunteer's results. I'll ask you a few easy questions about your code, and you'll get participation points (or EC). \n\nI have set up a Zoom room with a short link: {{< var url.bitly >}}.\n\nWe'll use that link/zoom room all semester to share screen (since this room doesn't have a screen sharing protocol).\n\nFor instance, last week we ran into the following try-it:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### TRY IT\n\n1. What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? The formula for the sum of integers $1$ through $n$ is $n(n+1)/2$. Define $n=100$ and then use `R` to compute the sum of $1$ through $100$ using the formula. What is the sum?\n  \n:::\n\nI didn't read my own notes closesly and thought we needed `seq(...)` or the shortcut `1:100` to do this, but we actually don't because we are given the equation $n(n+1)/2$. So, let's try out our first **TRY-IT** and ask everyone to calculate the sum of the numbers 1 to 100 ($n=100$) using both the formula above, and the `seq(...)` function to sum up the numbers 1 to 100.\n\n\n\n## Guiding Question\n\nFor future lectures, the guiding questions will be more pointed and at a higher level to help steer your thinking. Here, we want to ensure you remember some basics and accordingly the questions are straightforward.\n\n- Why do we want tidy data?\n- What are the challenges associated with shaping things into a tidy format?\n\n\n# The tidyverse  {#tidyverse}\n\nIn last week's content and lab, we demonstrated how to manipulate vectors by reordering and subsetting them through indexing. However, once we start more advanced analyses, the preferred unit for data storage is not the vector but the data frame.  In this lecture, we learn to work directly with data frames, which greatly facilitate the organization of information. We will be using data frames for the majority of this class and you will use them for the majority of your data science life (however long that might be). We will focus on a specific data format referred to as _tidy_ and on specific collection of packages that are particularly helpful for working with _tidy_ data referred to as the _tidyverse_.\n\nWe can load all the tidyverse packages at once by installing and loading the __tidyverse__ package:^[If you have not installed this package already, you must use `install.packages(\"tidyverse\")` prior to the `library()` call you see below.]\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will learn how to implement the tidyverse approach throughout the book, but before delving into the details, in this chapter we introduce some of the most widely used tidyverse functionality, starting with the __dplyr__ package for manipulating data frames and the __purrr__ package for working with functions. Note that the tidyverse also includes a graphing package, __ggplot2__,  the __readr__ package, and many others. In this lesson, we first introduce the concept of _tidy data_ and then demonstrate how we use the tidyverse to work with data frames in this format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tidy data {#tidy-data}\n\n> We say that a data table is in  _tidy_ format if each row represents one observation and columns represent the different variables available for each of these observations. The `murders` dataset is an example of a tidy data frame.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(murders)\nhead(murders)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       state abb region population total\n1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135\n2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19\n3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232\n4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93\n5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257\n6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nEach row represent a state with each of the five columns providing a different variable related to these states: name, abbreviation, region, population, and total murders.\n\nTo see how the same information can be provided in different formats, consider the following example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      country year fertility\n1     Germany 1960      2.41\n2 South Korea 1960      6.16\n3     Germany 1961      2.44\n4 South Korea 1961      5.99\n5     Germany 1962      2.47\n6 South Korea 1962      5.79\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis tidy dataset provides fertility rates for two countries across the years. This is a tidy dataset because each row presents one observation with the three variables being country, year, and fertility rate. However, this dataset originally came in another format and was reshaped for the __dslabs__ package. Originally, the data was in the following format:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      country 1960 1961 1962\n1     Germany 2.41 2.44 2.47\n2 South Korea 6.16 5.99 5.79\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe same information is provided, but there are two important differences in the format: 1) each row includes several observations and 2) one of the variables' values, year, is stored in the header. For the tidyverse packages to be optimally used, data need to be reshaped into `tidy` format, which you will learn to do throughout this course. For starters, though, we will use example datasets that are already in tidy format.\n\nAlthough not immediately obvious, as you go through the book you will start to appreciate the advantages of working in a framework in which functions use tidy formats for both inputs and outputs. You will see how this permits the data analyst to focus on more important aspects of the analysis rather than the format of the data.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## TRY IT \n\n1. Examine the built-in dataset `co2`. Which of the following is true:\n\na. `co2` is tidy data: it has one year for each row.\nb. `co2` is not tidy: we need at least one column with a character vector.\nc. `co2` is not tidy:  it is a matrix instead of a data frame.\nd. `co2` is not tidy: to be tidy we would have to wrangle it to have three columns (year, month and value), then each co2 observation would have a row.\n\n2. Examine the built-in dataset  `ChickWeight`. Which of the following is true:\n\na.  `ChickWeight` is not tidy: each chick has more than one row.\nb.  `ChickWeight` is tidy: each observation (a weight) is represented by one row. The chick from which this measurement came is one of the variables.\nc.  `ChickWeight` is not tidy: we are missing the year column.\nd.  `ChickWeight` is tidy: it is stored in a data frame.\n\n3. Examine the built-in dataset `BOD`. Which of the following is true:\n\na. `BOD` is not tidy: it only has six rows.\nb. `BOD` is not tidy: the first column is just an index.\nc. `BOD` is tidy: each row is an observation with two values (time and demand)\nd. `BOD` is tidy: all small datasets are tidy by definition.\n\n\n4. Which of the following built-in datasets is tidy (you can pick more than one):\n\na. `BJsales`\nb. `EuStockMarkets`\nd. `DNase`\nd. `Formaldehyde`\ne. `Orange`\nf. `UCBAdmissions`\n\n:::\n\n## Manipulating data frames\n\nThe __dplyr__ package from the __tidyverse__ introduces functions that perform some of the most common operations when working with data frames and uses names for these functions that are relatively easy to remember. For instance, to change the data table by adding a new column, we use `mutate`.  To filter the data table to a subset of rows, we use `filter`. Finally, to subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use `select`.\n\n### Adding a column with `mutate`\n\nWe want all the necessary information for our analysis to be included in the data table. So the first task is to add the murder rates to our murders data frame.  The function `mutate`  takes the data frame as a first argument and the name and values of the variable as a second argument using the convention `name = values`. So, to add murder rates, we use:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(\"murders\")\nmurders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNotice that here we used `total` and `population` inside the function, which are objects that are **not** defined in our workspace. But why don't we get an error?\n\nThis is one of __dplyr__'s main features. Functions in this package, such as `mutate`, know to look for variables __in__ the data frame provided in the first argument. In the call to mutate above, `total` will have the values in `murders$total`. This approach makes the code much more readable.\n\nWe can see that the new column is added:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(murders)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       state abb region population total     rate\n1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135 2.824424\n2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19 2.675186\n3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232 3.629527\n4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93 3.189390\n5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257 3.374138\n6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65 1.292453\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote: Although we have overwritten the original `murders` object, this does not change the object that loaded with `data(murders)`. If we load the `murders` data again, the original will overwrite our mutated version.\n\n### Subsetting with `filter`\n\nNow suppose that we want to filter the data table to only show the entries for which the murder rate is lower than 0.71. To do this we use the `filter` function, which takes the data table as the first argument and then the conditional statement as the second. Like `mutate`, we can use the unquoted variable names from `murders` inside the function and it will know we mean the columns and not objects in the workspace.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(murders, rate <= 0.71)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          state abb        region population total      rate\n1        Hawaii  HI          West    1360301     7 0.5145920\n2          Iowa  IA North Central    3046355    21 0.6893484\n3 New Hampshire  NH     Northeast    1316470     5 0.3798036\n4  North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4 0.5947151\n5       Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2 0.3196211\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Selecting columns with `select`\n\nAlthough our data table only has six columns, some data tables include hundreds. If we want to view just a few, we can use the __dplyr__ `select` function. In the code below we select three columns, assign this to a new object and then filter the new object:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_table <- select(murders, state, region, rate)\nfilter(new_table, rate <= 0.71)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          state        region      rate\n1        Hawaii          West 0.5145920\n2          Iowa North Central 0.6893484\n3 New Hampshire     Northeast 0.3798036\n4  North Dakota North Central 0.5947151\n5       Vermont     Northeast 0.3196211\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn the call to `select`, the first argument `murders` is an object, but `state`, `region`, and `rate` are variable names.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## TRY IT\n\n1. Load the __dplyr__ package and the murders dataset.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(murders)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can add columns using the __dplyr__ function `mutate`. This function is aware of the column names and inside the function you can call them unquoted:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders <- mutate(murders, population_in_millions = population / 10^6)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can write `population` rather than `murders$population` because `mutate` is part of `dplyr`. The function `mutate` knows we are grabbing columns from `murders`.\n\nUse the function `mutate` to add a murders column named `rate` with the per 100,000 murder rate as in the example code above. Make sure you redefine `murders` as done in the example code above ( murders <- [your code]) so we can keep using this variable.\n\n2. If `rank(x)` gives you the ranks of `x` from lowest to highest, `rank(-x)` gives you the ranks from highest to lowest. Use the function `mutate` to add a column `rank` containing the rank, from highest to lowest murder rate. Make sure you redefine `murders` so we can keep using this variable.\n\n3. With __dplyr__, we can use `select` to show only certain columns. For example, with this code we would only show the states and population sizes:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(murders, state, population) %>% head()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUse `select` to show the state names and abbreviations in `murders`. Do not redefine `murders`, just show the results.\n\n\n4. The __dplyr__ function `filter` is used to choose specific rows of the data frame to keep. Unlike `select` which is for columns, `filter` is for rows. For example, you can show just the New York row like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(murders, state == \"New York\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can use other logical vectors to filter rows.\n\nUse `filter` to show the top 5 states with the highest murder rates. After we add murder rate and rank, do not change the murders dataset, just show the result. Remember that you can filter based on the `rank` column.\n\n\n5. We can remove rows using the `!=` operator. For example, to remove Florida, we would do this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nno_florida <- filter(murders, state != \"Florida\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new data frame called `no_south` that removes states from the South region. How many states are in this category? You can use the function `nrow` for this.\n\n\n6. We can also use `%in%` to filter with __dplyr__. You can therefore see the data from New York and Texas like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(murders, state %in% c(\"New York\", \"Texas\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new data frame called `murders_nw` with only the states from the Northeast and the West.  How many states are in this category?\n\n\n7. Suppose you want to live in the Northeast or West **and** want the murder rate to be less than 1. We want to see the data for the states satisfying these options. Note that you can use logical operators with `filter`. Here is an example in which we filter to keep only small states in the Northeast region.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(murders, population < 5000000 & region == \"Northeast\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nMake sure `murders` has been defined with `rate` and `rank` and still has all states. Create a table called `my_states` that contains rows for states satisfying both the conditions: it is in the Northeast or West and the murder rate is less than 1.  Use `select` to show only the state name, the rate, and the rank.\n\n:::\n\n## The pipe: `%>%`\n\nWith __dplyr__ we can perform a series of operations, for example `select` and then `filter`, by sending the results of one function to another using what is called the _pipe operator_: `%>%`. Some details are included below.\n\nWe wrote code above to show three variables (state, region, rate) for states that have murder rates below 0.71. To do this, we defined the intermediate object `new_table`. In __dplyr__ we can write code that looks more like a description of what we want to do without intermediate objects:\n\n$$ \\mbox{original data }\n\\rightarrow \\mbox{ select }\n\\rightarrow \\mbox{ filter } $$\n\n\nFor such an operation, we can use the pipe `%>%`. The code looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>% select(state, region, rate) %>% filter(rate <= 0.71)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          state        region      rate\n1        Hawaii          West 0.5145920\n2          Iowa North Central 0.6893484\n3 New Hampshire     Northeast 0.3798036\n4  North Dakota North Central 0.5947151\n5       Vermont     Northeast 0.3196211\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis line of code is equivalent to the two lines of code above. What is going on here?\n\nIn general, the pipe _sends_ the result of the left side of the pipe to be the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe. Here is a very simple example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n16 %>% sqrt()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can continue to pipe values along:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n16 %>% sqrt() %>% log2()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above statement is equivalent to `log2(sqrt(16))`.\n\nRemember that the pipe sends values to the first argument, so we can define other arguments as if the first argument is already defined:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n16 %>% sqrt() %>% log(base = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, when using the pipe with data frames and __dplyr__, we no longer need to specify the required first argument since the __dplyr__ functions we have described all take the data as the first argument. In the code we wrote:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>% select(state, region, rate) %>% filter(rate <= 0.71)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n`murders` is the first argument of the `select` function, and the new data frame (formerly `new_table`) is the first argument of the `filter` function.\n\nNote that the pipe works well with functions where the first argument is the input data. Functions in __tidyverse__ packages like __dplyr__ have this format and can be used easily with the pipe. It's worth noting that as of R 4.1, there is a base-R version of the pipe `|>`, though this has its disadvantages. We'll stick with `%>%` for now.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## TRY IT\n\n1. The pipe `%>%` can be used to perform operations sequentially without having to define intermediate objects. Start by redefining murder to include rate and rank.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders <- mutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000,\n                  rank = rank(-rate))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn the solution to the previous exercise, we did the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_states <- filter(murders, region %in% c(\"Northeast\", \"West\") &\n                      rate < 1)\n\nselect(my_states, state, rate, rank)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe pipe `%>%` permits us to perform both operations sequentially without having to define an intermediate variable `my_states`. We therefore could have mutated and selected in the same line like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmutate(murders, rate =  total / population * 100000,\n       rank = rank(-rate)) %>%\n  select(state, rate, rank)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNotice that `select` no longer has a data frame as the first argument. The first argument is assumed to be the result of the operation conducted right before the  `%>%`.\n\nRepeat the previous exercise, but now instead of creating a new object, show the result and only include the state, rate, and rank columns. Use a pipe `%>%` to do this in just one line.\n\n2. Reset `murders` to the original table by using `data(murders)`. Use a pipe to create a new data frame called `my_states` that considers only states in the Northeast or West which have a murder rate lower than 1, and contains only the state, rate and rank columns. The pipe should also have four components separated by three `%>%`. The code should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_states <- murders %>%\n  mutate SOMETHING %>%\n  filter SOMETHING %>%\n  select SOMETHING\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Summarizing data\n\nAn important part of exploratory data analysis is summarizing data. The average and standard deviation are two examples of widely used summary statistics. More informative summaries can often be achieved by first splitting data into groups. In this section, we cover two new __dplyr__ verbs that make these computations easier: `summarize` and `group_by`. We learn to access resulting values using the `pull` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### `summarize` {#summarize}\n\nThe `summarize` function in __dplyr__ provides a way to compute summary statistics with intuitive and readable code. We start with a simple example based on heights. The `heights` dataset includes  heights and sex reported by students in an in-class survey.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(heights)\nhead(heights)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     sex height\n1   Male     75\n2   Male     70\n3   Male     68\n4   Male     74\n5   Male     61\n6 Female     65\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe following code computes the average and standard deviation for females:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns <- heights %>%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %>%\n  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))\ns\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   average standard_deviation\n1 64.93942           3.760656\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis takes our original data table as input, filters it to keep only females, and then produces a new summarized table with just the average and the standard deviation of heights. We get to choose the names of the columns of the resulting table. For example, above we decided to use `average` and `standard_deviation`, but we could have used other names just the same.\n\nBecause the resulting table stored in `s` is a data frame, we can access the components with the accessor `$`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns$average\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 64.93942\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns$standard_deviation\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.760656\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs with most other __dplyr__ functions, `summarize` is aware of the variable names and we can use them directly. So when inside the call to the `summarize` function we write `mean(height)`, the function is accessing the column with the name \"height\" and then computing the average of the resulting numeric vector. We can compute any other summary that operates on vectors and returns a single value. For example, we can add the median, minimum, and maximum heights like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %>%\n  summarize(median = median(height), minimum = min(height),\n            maximum = max(height))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    median minimum maximum\n1 64.98031      51      79\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can obtain these three values with just one line using the `quantile` function: for example, `quantile(x, c(0,0.5,1))` returns the min (0th percentile), median (50th percentile), and max (100th percentile) of the vector `x`. However, if we attempt to use a function like this that returns two or more values inside `summarize`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %>%\n  summarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nwe will receive an error: `Error: expecting result of length one, got : 2`. With the function `summarize`, we can only call functions that return a single value. In later sections, we will learn how to deal with functions that return more than one value.\n\nFor another example of how we can use the `summarize` function, let's compute the average murder rate for the United States. Remember our data table includes total murders and population size for each state and we have already used __dplyr__ to add a murder rate column:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders <- murders %>% mutate(rate = total/population*100000)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nRemember that the US murder rate is **not** the average of the state murder rates:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(murders, mean(rate))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  mean(rate)\n1   2.779125\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is because in the computation above the small states are given the same weight as the large ones. The US murder rate is the total number of murders in the US divided by the total US population. So the correct computation is:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_murder_rate <- murders %>%\n  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000)\nus_murder_rate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      rate\n1 3.034555\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis computation counts larger states proportionally to their size which results in a larger value.\n\n### `pull`\n\nThe `us_murder_rate` object defined above represents just one number. Yet we are storing it in a data frame:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(us_murder_rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nsince, as most __dplyr__ functions, `summarize` always returns a data frame.\n\nThis might be problematic if we want to use this result with functions that require a numeric value. Here we show a useful trick for accessing values stored in data when using pipes: when a data object is piped that object and its columns can be accessed using the `pull` function. To understand what we mean take a look at this line of code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_murder_rate %>% pull(rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.034555\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis returns the value in the `rate` column of `us_murder_rate` making it equivalent to `us_murder_rate$rate`.\n\nTo get a number from the original data table with one line of code we can type:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_murder_rate <- murders %>%\n  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000) %>%\n  pull(rate)\n\nus_murder_rate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.034555\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nwhich is now a numeric:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(us_murder_rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Group then summarize with `group_by`\n\nA common operation in data exploration is to first split data into groups and then compute summaries for each group. For example, we may want to compute the average and standard deviation for men's and women's heights separately. The `group_by` function helps us do this.\n\nIf we type this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>% group_by(sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1,050 × 2\n# Groups:   sex [2]\n   sex    height\n   <fct>   <dbl>\n 1 Male       75\n 2 Male       70\n 3 Male       68\n 4 Male       74\n 5 Male       61\n 6 Female     65\n 7 Female     66\n 8 Female     62\n 9 Female     66\n10 Male       67\n# ℹ 1,040 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe result does not look very different from `heights`, except we see `Groups: sex [2]` when we print the object. Although not immediately obvious from its appearance, this is now a special data frame called a _grouped data frame_, and __dplyr__ functions, in particular `summarize`, will behave differently when acting on this object. Conceptually, you can think of this table as many tables, with the same columns but not necessarily the same number of rows, stacked together in one object. When we summarize the data after grouping, this is what happens:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  group_by(sex) %>%\n  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  sex    average standard_deviation\n  <fct>    <dbl>              <dbl>\n1 Female    64.9               3.76\n2 Male      69.3               3.61\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `summarize` function applies the summarization to each group separately.\n\nFor another example, let's compute the median murder rate in the four regions of the country:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  group_by(region) %>%\n  summarize(median_rate = median(rate))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  region        median_rate\n  <fct>               <dbl>\n1 Northeast            1.80\n2 South                3.40\n3 North Central        1.97\n4 West                 1.29\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Sorting data frames\n\nWhen examining a dataset, it is often convenient to sort the table by the different columns. We know about the `order` and `sort` function, but for ordering entire tables, the __dplyr__ function `arrange` is useful. For example, here we order the states by population size:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  arrange(population) %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                 state abb        region population total       rate\n1              Wyoming  WY          West     563626     5  0.8871131\n2 District of Columbia  DC         South     601723    99 16.4527532\n3              Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2  0.3196211\n4         North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4  0.5947151\n5               Alaska  AK          West     710231    19  2.6751860\n6         South Dakota  SD North Central     814180     8  0.9825837\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith `arrange` we get to decide which column to sort by. To see the states by murder rate, from lowest to highest, we arrange by `rate` instead:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  arrange(rate) %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          state abb        region population total      rate\n1       Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2 0.3196211\n2 New Hampshire  NH     Northeast    1316470     5 0.3798036\n3        Hawaii  HI          West    1360301     7 0.5145920\n4  North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4 0.5947151\n5          Iowa  IA North Central    3046355    21 0.6893484\n6         Idaho  ID          West    1567582    12 0.7655102\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. In __dplyr__, the function `desc` transforms a vector so that it is in descending order. To sort the table in descending order, we can type:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  arrange(desc(rate))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Nested sorting\n\nIf we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second column to break the tie. Similarly, a third column can be used to break ties between first and second and so on. Here we order by `region`, then within region we order by murder rate:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  arrange(region, rate) %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          state abb    region population total      rate\n1       Vermont  VT Northeast     625741     2 0.3196211\n2 New Hampshire  NH Northeast    1316470     5 0.3798036\n3         Maine  ME Northeast    1328361    11 0.8280881\n4  Rhode Island  RI Northeast    1052567    16 1.5200933\n5 Massachusetts  MA Northeast    6547629   118 1.8021791\n6      New York  NY Northeast   19378102   517 2.6679599\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### The top $n$\n\nIn the code above, we have used the function `head` to avoid having the page fill up with the entire dataset. If we want to see a larger proportion, we can use the `top_n` function. This function takes a data frame as it's first argument, the number of rows to show in the second, and the variable to filter by in the third. Here is an example of how to see the top 5 rows:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>% top_n(5, rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                 state abb        region population total      rate\n1 District of Columbia  DC         South     601723    99 16.452753\n2            Louisiana  LA         South    4533372   351  7.742581\n3             Maryland  MD         South    5773552   293  5.074866\n4             Missouri  MO North Central    5988927   321  5.359892\n5       South Carolina  SC         South    4625364   207  4.475323\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that rows are not sorted by `rate`, only filtered. If we want to sort, we need to use `arrange`.\nNote that if the third argument is left blank, `top_n` filters by the last column.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## TRY IT\n\nFor these exercises, we will be using the data from the survey collected by the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This center has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the 1960’s. Starting in 1999, about 5,000 individuals of all ages have been interviewed every year and they complete the health examination component of the survey. Part of the data is made available via the __NHANES__ package. Once you install the __NHANES__ package, you can load the data like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(NHANES)\ndata(NHANES)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe __NHANES__ data has many missing values. The `mean` and `sd` functions in R will return `NA` if any of the entries of the input vector is an `NA`. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(na_example)\nmean(na_example)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(na_example)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo ignore the `NA`s we can use the `na.rm` argument:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.301754\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(na_example, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.22338\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's now explore the NHANES data.\n\n1. We will provide some basic facts about blood pressure. First let's select a group to set the standard. We will use 20-to-29-year-old females. `AgeDecade` is a categorical variable with these ages. Note that the category is coded like \" 20-29\", with a space in front! What is the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as saved in the `BPSysAve` variable? Save it to a variable called `ref`.\n\nHint: Use `filter` and `summarize` and use the `na.rm = TRUE` argument when computing the average and standard deviation. You can also filter the NA values using `filter`.\n\n\n2. Using a pipe, assign the average to a numeric variable `ref_avg`. Hint: Use the code similar to above and then `pull`.\n\n\n3. Now report the min and max values for the same group.\n\n\n4. Compute the average and standard deviation for females, but for each age group separately rather than a selected decade as in question 1. Note that the age groups are defined by `AgeDecade`. Hint: rather than filtering by age and gender, filter by `Gender` and then use `group_by`.\n\n5. Repeat exercise 4 for males.\n\n6. We can actually combine both summaries for exercises 4 and 5 into one line of code. This is because `group_by` permits us to group by more than one variable. Obtain one big summary table using `group_by(AgeDecade, Gender)`.\n\n7. For males between the ages of 40-49, compare systolic blood pressure across race as reported in the `Race1` variable. Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.\n:::\n\n\n## Tibbles\n\nTidy data must be stored in data frames. We have been using the `murders` data frame throughout the unit. In an earlier section we introduced the `group_by` function, which permits stratifying data before computing summary statistics. But where is the group information stored in the data frame?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>% group_by(region)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 51 × 6\n# Groups:   region [4]\n   state                abb   region    population total  rate\n   <chr>                <chr> <fct>          <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 Alabama              AL    South        4779736   135  2.82\n 2 Alaska               AK    West          710231    19  2.68\n 3 Arizona              AZ    West         6392017   232  3.63\n 4 Arkansas             AR    South        2915918    93  3.19\n 5 California           CA    West        37253956  1257  3.37\n 6 Colorado             CO    West         5029196    65  1.29\n 7 Connecticut          CT    Northeast    3574097    97  2.71\n 8 Delaware             DE    South         897934    38  4.23\n 9 District of Columbia DC    South         601723    99 16.5 \n10 Florida              FL    South       19687653   669  3.40\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are no columns with this information. But, if you look closely at the output above, you see the line `A tibble` followed by dimensions. We can learn the class of the returned object using:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>% group_by(region) %>% class()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"grouped_df\" \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `tbl`, pronounced tibble, is a special kind of data frame. The functions `group_by` and `summarize` always return this type of data frame. The `group_by` function returns a special kind of `tbl`, the `grouped_df`. We will say more about these later. For consistency, the __dplyr__ manipulation verbs (`select`, `filter`, `mutate`, and `arrange`) preserve the class of the input: if they receive a regular data frame they return a regular data frame, while if they receive a tibble they return a tibble. But tibbles are the preferred format in the tidyverse and as a result tidyverse functions that produce a data frame from scratch return a tibble. \n\nTibbles are very similar to data frames. In fact, you can think of them as a modern version of data frames. Nonetheless there are three important differences which we describe next.\n\n### Tibbles display better\n\nThe print method for tibbles is more readable than that of a data frame. To see this, compare the outputs of typing `murders` and the output of murders if we convert it to a tibble. We can do this using `as_tibble(murders)`. If using `RStudio`, output for a tibble adjusts to your window size. To see this, change the width of your R console and notice how more/less columns are shown.\n\n### Subsets of tibbles are tibbles\n\nIf you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame, such as a vector or scalar. For example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(murders[,4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nis not a data frame. With tibbles this does not happen:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(as_tibble(murders)[,4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.\n\nWith tibbles, if you want to access the vector that defines a column, and not get back a data frame, you need to use the accessor `$`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(as_tibble(murders)$population)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA related feature is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist. If we accidentally write `Population` instead of `population` this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders$Population\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNULL\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nreturns a `NULL` with no warning, which can make it harder to debug. In contrast, if we try this with a tibble we get an informative warning:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas_tibble(murders)$Population\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNULL\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ### Tibbles can have complex entries -->\n\n<!-- While data frame columns need to be vectors of numbers, strings, or logical values, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions. Also, we can create tibbles with functions: -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- tibble(id = c(1, 2, 3), func = c(mean, median, sd)) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n### Tibbles can be grouped\n\nThe function `group_by` returns a special kind of tibble: a grouped tibble. This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups. The tidyverse functions, in particular the `summarize` function, are aware of the group information.\n\n### Create a tibble using `tibble` instead of `data.frame`\n\nIt is sometimes useful for us to create our own data frames. To create a data frame in the tibble format, you can do this by using the `tibble` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades <- tibble(names = c(\"John\", \"Juan\", \"Jean\", \"Yao\"),\n                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\n                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that base R (without packages loaded) has a function with a very similar name, `data.frame`, that can be used to create a regular data frame rather than a tibble.  One other important difference is that by default `data.frame` coerces characters into factors without providing a warning or message:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades <- data.frame(names = c(\"John\", \"Juan\", \"Jean\", \"Yao\"),\n                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\n                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90))\nclass(grades$names)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid this, we use the rather cumbersome argument `stringsAsFactors`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades <- data.frame(names = c(\"John\", \"Juan\", \"Jean\", \"Yao\"),\n                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85),\n                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90),\n                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nclass(grades$names)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo convert a regular data frame to a tibble, you can use the  `as_tibble` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas_tibble(grades) %>% class()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## The dot operator\n\nOne of the advantages of using the pipe `%>%` is that we do not have to keep naming new objects as we manipulate the data frame. As a quick reminder, if we want to compute the median murder rate for states in the southern states, instead of typing:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab_1 <- filter(murders, region == \"South\")\ntab_2 <- mutate(tab_1, rate = total / population * 10^5)\nrates <- tab_2$rate\nmedian(rates)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.398069\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can avoid defining any new intermediate objects by instead typing:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(murders, region == \"South\") %>%\n  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %>%\n  summarize(median = median(rate)) %>%\n  pull(median)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.398069\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this because each of these functions takes a data frame as the first argument. But what if we want to access a component of the data frame. For example, what if the `pull` function was not available and we wanted to access `tab_2$rate`? What data frame name would we use? The answer is the dot operator.\n\nFor example to access the rate vector without the `pull` function we could use\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrates <-   filter(murders, region == \"South\") %>%\n  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %>%\n  .$rate\nmedian(rates)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.398069\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we will see other instances in which using the `.` is useful.\n\n## `do` {#do}\n\nThe tidyverse functions know how to interpret grouped tibbles. Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe `%>%`, tidyverse functions consistently take data frames and return data frames, since this assures that the output of a function is accepted as the input of another. But most R functions do not recognize grouped tibbles nor do they return data frames. The `quantile` function is an example we described earlier. The `do` function serves as a bridge between R functions such as `quantile` and the tidyverse. The `do` function understands grouped tibbles and always returns a data frame.\n\nIn the summarize section (above), we noted that if we attempt to use `quantile` to obtain the min, median and max in one call, we will receive something unexpected. Prior to R 4.1, we would receive an error. After R 4.1, we actually get:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(heights)\nheights %>%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %>%\n  summarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe probably wanted three columns: min, median, and max. We can use the `do` function to fix this.\n\nFirst we have to write a function that fits into the tidyverse approach: that is, it receives a data frame and returns a data frame. Note that it returns a single-row data frame.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_summary <- function(dat){\n  x <- quantile(dat$height, c(0, 0.5, 1))\n  tibble(min = x[1], median = x[2], max = x[3])\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can now apply the function to the heights dataset to obtain the summaries:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  group_by(sex) %>%\n  my_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n    min median   max\n  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1    50   68.5  82.7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBut this is not what we want. We want a summary for each sex and the code returned just one summary. This is because `my_summary` is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handled grouped tibbles. `do` makes this connection:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  group_by(sex) %>%\n  do(my_summary(.))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n# Groups:   sex [2]\n  sex      min median   max\n  <fct>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Female    51   65.0  79  \n2 Male      50   69    82.7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that here we need to use the dot operator. The tibble created by `group_by`  is piped to `do`. Within the call to `do`, the name of this tibble is `.` and we want to send it to `my_summary`. If you do not use the dot, then `my_summary` has _no argument_ and returns an error telling us that `argument \"dat\"` is missing. You can see the error by typing:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  group_by(sex) %>%\n  do(my_summary())\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not use the parenthesis, then the function is not executed and instead `do` tries to return the function. This gives an error because `do` must always return a data frame. You can see the error by typing:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheights %>%\n  group_by(sex) %>%\n  do(my_summary)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo `do` serves as a bridge between non-tidyverse functions and the tidyverse.\n\n## The __purrr__ package\n\nIn previous sections (and labs) we learned about the `sapply` function, which permitted us to apply the same function to each element of a vector. We constructed a function and used `sapply` to compute the sum of the first `n` integers for several values of `n` like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompute_s_n <- function(n){\n  x <- 1:n\n  sum(x)\n}\nn <- 1:25\ns_n <- sapply(n, compute_s_n)\ns_n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1]   1   3   6  10  15  21  28  36  45  55  66  78  91 105 120 136 153 171 190\n[20] 210 231 253 276 300 325\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis type of operation, applying the same function or procedure to elements of an object, is quite common in data analysis. The __purrr__ package includes functions similar to `sapply` but that better interact with other tidyverse functions. The main advantage is that we can better control the output type of functions. In contrast, `sapply` can return several different object types; for example, we might expect a numeric result from a line of code, but `sapply` might convert our result to character under some circumstances. __purrr__ functions will never do this: they will return objects of a specified type or return an error if this is not possible.\n\nThe first __purrr__ function we will learn is `map`, which works very similar to `sapply` but always, without exception, returns a list:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(purrr) # or library(tidyverse)\nn <- 1:25\ns_n <- map(n, compute_s_n)\nclass(s_n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"list\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf we want a numeric vector, we can instead use `map_dbl` which always returns a vector of numeric values.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns_n <- map_dbl(n, compute_s_n)\nclass(s_n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis produces the same results as the `sapply` call shown above.\n\nA particularly useful __purrr__ function for interacting with the rest of the tidyverse is `map_df`, which always returns a tibble data frame. However, the function being called needs to return a vector or a list with names. For this reason, the following code would result in a `Argument 1 must have names` error:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns_n <- map_df(n, compute_s_n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe need to change the function to make this work:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompute_s_n <- function(n){\n  x <- 1:n\n  tibble(sum = sum(x))\n}\ns_n <- map_df(n, compute_s_n)\nhead(s_n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n    sum\n  <int>\n1     1\n2     3\n3     6\n4    10\n5    15\n6    21\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBecause `map_df` returns a tibble, we can have more columns defined in our function and returned. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompute_s_n2 <- function(n){\n  x <- 1:n\n  tibble(sum = sum(x), sumSquared = sum(x^2))\n}\ns_n <- map_df(n, compute_s_n2)\nhead(s_n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n    sum sumSquared\n  <int>      <dbl>\n1     1          1\n2     3          5\n3     6         14\n4    10         30\n5    15         55\n6    21         91\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe __purrr__ package provides much more functionality not covered here. For more details you can consult [this online resource](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/).\n\n\n## Tidyverse conditionals\n\nA typical data analysis will often involve one or more conditional operations. In the section on Conditionals, we described the `ifelse` function, which we will use extensively in this book. In this section we present two __dplyr__ functions that provide further functionality for performing conditional operations.\n\n### `case_when`\n\nThe `case_when` function is useful for vectorizing conditional statements. It is similar to `ifelse` but can output any number of values, as opposed to just `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Here is an example splitting numbers into negative, positive, and 0:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)\ncase_when(x < 0 ~ \"Negative\",\n          x > 0 ~ \"Positive\",\n          x == 0  ~ \"Zero\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Negative\" \"Negative\" \"Zero\"     \"Positive\" \"Positive\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA common use for this function is to define categorical variables based on existing variables. For example, suppose we want to compare the murder rates in four groups of states: _New England_, _West Coast_, _South_,  and _other_. For each state, we need to ask if it is in New England, if it is not we ask if it is in the West Coast, if not we ask if it is in the South, and if not we assign _other_. Here is how we use `case_when` to do this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmurders %>%\n  mutate(group = case_when(\n    abb %in% c(\"ME\", \"NH\", \"VT\", \"MA\", \"RI\", \"CT\") ~ \"New England\",\n    abb %in% c(\"WA\", \"OR\", \"CA\") ~ \"West Coast\",\n    region == \"South\" ~ \"South\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\")) %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 10^5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  group        rate\n  <chr>       <dbl>\n1 New England  1.72\n2 Other        2.71\n3 South        3.63\n4 West Coast   2.90\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThat `TRUE` on the fourth line of `case_when` serves as a catch-all. As `case_when` steps through the conditions, if none of them are true, it comes to the last line. Since `TRUE` is always true, the function will return \"Other\". Leaving out the last line of `case_when` would result in `NA` values for any observation that fails the first three conditionals. This may or may not be what you want.\n\n### `between`\n\nA common operation in data analysis is to determine if a value falls inside an interval. We can check this using conditionals. For example, to check if the elements of a vector `x` are between `a` and `b` we can type\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx >= a & x <= b\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this can become cumbersome, especially within the tidyverse approach. The  `between` function performs the same operation.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbetween(x, a, b)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## TRY IT\n\n1. Load the `murders` dataset. Which of the following is true?\n\na. `murders` is in tidy format and is stored in a tibble.\nb. `murders` is in tidy format and is stored in a data frame.\nc. `murders` is not in tidy format and is stored in a tibble.\nd. `murders` is not in tidy format and is stored in a data frame.\n\n2. Use `as_tibble` to convert the `murders` data table into a tibble and save it in an object called `murders_tibble`.\n\n3. Use the `group_by` function to convert `murders` into a tibble that is grouped by region.\n\n4. Write tidyverse code that is equivalent to this code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(mean(log(murders$population)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWrite it using the pipe so that each function is called without arguments. Use the dot operator to access the population. Hint: The code should start with `murders %>%`.\n\n5. Use the `map_df` to create a data frame with three columns named `n`, `s_n`, and `s_n_2`. The first column should contain the numbers 1 through 100. The second and third columns should each contain the sum of 1 through $n$ with $n$ the row number.\n:::\n\n<!---\n# Videos\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n{{% youtube \"D6WqHA8TDWQ\" %}}\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-->",
