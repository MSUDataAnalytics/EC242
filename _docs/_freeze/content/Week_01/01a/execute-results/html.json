For this initial week, please read the course content for this week. **Read closely** the following:\n\n- The [syllabus](/syllabus/), [content](/content/), and [lab assignment](/assignment/) pages for this class.\n- This page. Yes, the whole thing.  \n\n\n### Guiding Question\n\nFor future lectures, the guiding questions will be more pointed and at a higher level to help steer your thinking. Here, we want to ensure you remember some basics and accordingly the questions are straightforward.\n\n- How does this course work?\n- Do you remember anything about `R`?\n- What are the different data types in `R`?\n- How do you index specific elements of a vector? Why might you want to do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Before we get started....\n\n**Please please please please please:** ask questions during class.\n\n- Most ideas will be new.\n\n- Sometimes (often?) the material itself will be confusing or interesting---or both!\n\n- **Note:** If I find that attendance is terrible, I may have to start incorporating attendance into participation.\n\nI encourage measured feedback and thoughtful responses to questions. If I call on you and you don't know immediately, don't freak out. If you don't know, it's totally okay to say you don't know.\n\n\n\n### Things To Remember (tl;dr)\n\nDo your weekly writing due **Saturday**. Begin working on Lab 0 as it is due Monday.\n\nKeys from the [syllabus](/syllabus/):\n\n- E-mail isn't the ideal solution for technical problems\n  - If you do send an email, please start it with `[EC242]` and the subject.\n- No appointments necessary for regularly scheduled office hours; or by appointment and via Slack\n- TA office hours are great as well. Our TA has experience in this course.\n- Notify me immediately if you need accommodations because of RCPD or religious convictions; If you approach me at the last minute, I may not be able to help.\n\nDespite my hard-assness in these introductory notes: I'm here to help and I am not in the business of giving bad grades for no reason.\n\n\n# What is \"Data Analytics\"?\n\n> I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. And I'm not kidding.\n\n#### Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google\n\nHow do **you** define \"data analytics\"?  (Not a rhetorical question!)\n\n- This course will avoid this nomenclature. It is confusing and imprecise. But you signed up (suckers) and I owe an explanation of what this course will cover.\n\nSome \"data analytics\" topics we will cover:\n\n- Linear regression: *il classico*.\n- LASSO\n- Models of classification or discrete choice.\n- Analysis of ``wide'' data.\n- Decision trees and other non-linear models.\n\n## Starting point for this course\n\nBetter utilizing existing data can improve our predictive power whilst providing interpretable outputs for considering new policies.\n\n**WARNING:** Causation is tough and we will spend the entire course warning you to avoid making causal claims!\n\n\n### Non-Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning\n**A Brief History**\n\nSuppose you are a researcher and you want to teach a computer to recognize images of a tree.\n\nNote: this is an ``easy\" problem. If you show pictures to a 3-year-old, that child will probably be able to tell you if there is a tree in the picture.\n\nComputer scientists spent about 20 years on this problem because they thought about the problem like nerds and tried to write down a series of rules.\n\nRules are difficult to form, and simply writing rules misses the key insight: the data can tell you something.\n\n\n### Social Science Approaches to Statistical Learning\n\n**A Brief History**\n\nSuppose you are a researcher and you want to know whether prisons reduce crime.\n\n\nfrom \"A Call for a Moratorium on Prison Building\" (1976)\n\n- Between 1955 and 1975, fifteen states increased the collective capacity of their adult prison systems by 56\\% (from, on average, 63,100 to 98,649).\n- Fifteen other states increased capacity by less than 4\\% (from 49,575 to 51,440).\n- In \"heavy-construction\" states the crime rate increased by 167\\%; in \"low-construction\" states the crime rate increased by 145\\%.\n\n| | Prison Capacity | Crime Rate\n| --- | --- | --- |\nHigh construction | $\\uparrow$~56\\% | $\\uparrow$~167\\%\nLow construction | $\\uparrow$~4\\% | $\\uparrow$~145\\%\n\n\n\n### The Pros and Cons of Correlation\n\nPros:\n\n  - Nature gives you correlations for free.\n  - In principle, everyone can agree on the facts.\n\nCons:\n\n  - Correlations are not very helpful.\n  - They show what has happened, but not why.\n  - For many things, we care about why. The social science perspective asks \"why?\"\n\n#### Why a Correlation Exists Between X and Y\n\n1. $X \\rightarrow Y$\n  X causes Y (causality)\n\n2. $X \\leftarrow Y$\n  Y causes X (reverse causality)\n\n3. $Z \\rightarrow X$; $Z \\rightarrow Y$\n  Z causes X and Y (common cause)\n\n4. $X \\rightarrow Y$; $Y \\rightarrow X$\n  X causes Y and Y causes X (simultaneous equations)\n\n\n#### Uniting Social Science and Computer Science\n\nWe will start in this course by examining situations where we do **not** care about why something has happened, but instead we care about our ability to predict its occurrence from existing data.\n\n(But of course keep in back of mind that if you are making policy, you must care about why something happened).\n\nWe will also borrow a few other ideas from CS:\n\n- Anything is data\n  + Satellite data\n  + Unstructured text or audio\n  + Facial expressions or vocal intonations\n- Subtle improvements on existing techniques\n- An eye towards practical implementability over \"cleanliness\"\n\n\n### A Case Study in Prediction\n\n**Example:** a firm wishes to predict user behavior based on previous purchases or interactions.\n\nSmall margins $\\rightarrow$ huge payoffs when *scaled up*.  \n\n$.01\\% \\rightarrow$ \\$10 million.\n\nNot obvious why this was true for Netflix; quite obvious why this is true in financial markets.\n\nFrom a computer science perspective, it only matters that you get that improvement (\\$\\$). From a social science perspective, we would want to use the predictions to learn more about *why*.\n\n\n\n\n### More Recent Examples of Prediction\n\n- Identify the risk factors for prostate cancer.\n- Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes, based on a gene expression profile.\n- Classify a recorded phoneme based on a log-periodogram.\n- Predict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical measurements.\n- Customize an email spam detection system.\n- Identify a hand-drawn object.\n- Determine which oscillations of stellar luminosity are likely due to exoplanets.\n- Identify food combinations that cause spikes in blood glucose level for an individual.\n- Establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data.\n\n\n### An Aside: Nomenclature\n\n**Machine learning** arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n**Statistical learning** arose as a subfield of Statistics.\n\nThere is much overlap; however, a few points of distinction:\n\n- Machine learning has a greater emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy.\n\n- Statistical learning emphasizes models and their interpretability, and precision and uncertainty.\n  - But the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of \"cross-fertilization\".\n\n**Obviously true:** machine learning has the upper hand in marketing.\n\n\n### Learning from Data\n\nThe following are the basic requirements for statistical learning:\n\n1. A pattern exists.\n2. This pattern is not easily expressed in a closed mathematical form.\n3. You have data.\n\n\n## Case study 1: Global Renewable Energy Production\n\nImagine you are evaluating countries for a potential investment in renewable energy. Headlines like \"Renewable Energy Capacity Growth Worldwide\" have piqued your interest. Reports from various sources show diverse graphs and charts and you're curious about the underlying data. You want to know which countries are leading the way in renewable energy production and which are lagging behind. You want to know which countries are growing their renewable energy production the fastest. In short: you want to know which countries are the best bets for investment. You might see something like the following: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou might want to look into the underlying data (in this case, fabricated) and think about what to do next. In this sense, you have *learned from data*. The data provides directions for exploration and clues as to potential explanations.\n\n##  Case study 2: US homicides by firearm\n\nImagine you live in Europe (if only!) and are offered a job in a US company with many locations in every state. It is a great job, but headlines such as **US Gun Homicide Rate Higher Than Other Developed Countries**^[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/us-gun-ownership-homicide-rate-higher-than-other-developed-countries/] have you worried. Fox News runs a scary looking graphic, and charts like the one below only add to you anxiety:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a_files/figure-html/murder-rate-example-1-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!--(Source:\n[Maâ€™ayan Rosenzweigh/ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/us-gun-ownership-homicide-rate-higher-than-other-developed-countries/), Data from UNODC Homicide Statistics) -->\n\nOr even worse, this version from [everytown.org](https://everytownresearch.org):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a_files/figure-html/murder-rate-example-2-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<!--(Source  [everytown.org](https://everytownresearch.org))-->\n\nBut then you remember that (1) this is a hypothetical exercise; (2) you'll take literally any job at this point; and (3) Geographic diversity matters -- the United States is a large and diverse country with 50 very different states (plus the District of Columbia and some lovely territories).^[I'm especially partial to Puerto Rico.]\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01a_files/figure-html/us-murders-by-state-map-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia, for example, has a larger population than Canada, and 20 US states have populations larger than that of Norway. In some respects, the variability across states in the US is akin to the variability across countries in Europe. Furthermore, although not included in the charts above, the murder rates in Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia are higher than 4 per 100,000. So perhaps the news reports that worried you are too superficial.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis is a relatively simple and straightforward problem in social science: you have options of where to live, and want to determine the safety of the various states. Your \"research\" is clearly policy-relevant: you will eventually have to live somewhere. In this course, we will begin to tackle the problem by examining data related to gun homicides in the US during 2010 using `R` as a motivating example along the way.\n\nBefore we get started with our example, we need to cover logistics as well as some of the very basic building blocks that are required to gain more advanced `R` skills. Ideally, this is a refresher. However, we are aware that your preparation in previously courses varies greatly from student to student. Moreover, we want you to be aware that the usefulness of some of these early building blocks may not be immediately obvious. Later in the class you will appreciate having these skills. Mastery will be rewarded both in this class and (of course) in life.\n\n\n### The Pre-Basics\n\nWe've now covered a short bit of material. The remainder of this first lecture will be covering setting up `R` and describing some common errors. For this, we'll head over to [resources](/resource/) to install R and RStudio. If you leave class without a working installation of these pieces of software, then you are likely to run into trouble in completing your first assignments.\n",
